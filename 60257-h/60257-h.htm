<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Brittany&rdquo; is the
story of the brief but eventful career of
Arthur, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet and
Constance of Brittany. Geoffrey was the
fourth son of Henry the Second of England and
Eleanor, Duchess of Guienne. Upon the death
of his brother Henry, Richard, surnamed the Lion-hearted,
became the heir apparent and succeeded to
the throne after the death of his father in 1189.
Richard shortly afterward became one of the leaders
of the Third Crusade, which ended disastrously.
After being taken prisoner in Austria by Duke
Leopold he was ransomed and returned to England,
where he suppressed the rebellion of his brother
John. He then invaded France to punish Philip
the Second, John&rsquo;s ally, but was mortally wounded
while besieging the fortress of Chalus, near Limoges.
On Richard&rsquo;s death, John, surnamed Lackland,
ascended the throne, ignoring the rightful claim
of Duke Arthur, Geoffrey&rsquo;s son. Almost his first
act was the murder of Arthur, who, with the encouragement
of Philip Augustus of France, was
prepared to defend his claim as the son of an elder
brother. By John&rsquo;s foul deed England lost its
French fiefs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>The story turns upon the events in Arthur&rsquo;s
short life, his young days in Brittany, the violent
death of his father, the relations of his mother to
Philip of France, the boy&rsquo;s love for his uncle Richard,
his service in the field with Philip, his espousal
to Marie of France, the war with John, his capture
and assassination by the latter. The incidental
characters are the Jew Abraham of Paris, Earl Salisbury,
the valiant knight H&ouml;el of Mordant and his
son Alan, between whom and Arthur existed a beautiful
friendship. Many of the scenes are of thrilling
dramatic interest, particularly the one in which
the crafty and malicious Queen Eleanor refrained
from blinding Arthur only because of his resemblance
to his father, her favorite son; the assassination
on shipboard; and the accusation of King John
by Alan. Some of the historical data in the story
are not accurate in minor details, but in general the
tale follows the versions of the historical authorities.
It is a fascinating picture of two lovable, high-minded,
chivalrous youths, worthy the study of the
youths of to-day.</p>

<h2>The Duke of Brittany</h2>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Hunt</span></h2>
<p>Near the close of the twelfth century a
hunting-castle stood in the northern part
of Brittany, in the midst of dense forests.
It belonged to Geoffrey Plantagenet,
Duke of Brittany<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>, and his banner was flying from
one of its towers, for the master had come for a
great hunt. His wife Constance and her ladies
accompanied him, though he was very reluctant to
have her come into that wild region; but Constance
would not be separated from her husband, and feared
neither the solitude of the gloomy forest nor the
fierce storms which occasionally swept over them
from the adjacent shores. Brittany was her home.
Her father, the last of the independent dukes, ruled
the eastern part of it, and she brought it as her heritage
to her husband, son of King Henry the Second
of England<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>. West Brittany, which was English, had
come into Geoffrey&rsquo;s possession, before this time,
from his father, and the two divisions were consolidated
by him into one dukedom. Constance
loved the country, and gladly visited this remote
hunting-castle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>On the second evening after her arrival, Constance
found herself alone with her attendants, for the Duke
and the nobles, who were taking part in the chase,
had ridden to the forest at early morning light with
their retinues.</p>
<p>There were but few guests, for many an old house
had lost its brave master, and many a strong castle
stood empty. Many of the stoutest vassals had
been drafted into the service of the English king,
and others had fallen in the French wars. The
country was impoverished and well-nigh deserted;
the Duke was no longer powerful enough to protect
it from marauding hordes and the ravages of wild
animals. He had come at this time not only to
indulge in the pleasures of the chase, but to restrain
these pillagers as far as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The Duchess and her ladies impatiently paced the
high stone terrace of the castle, stopping now and
then to scan the forest, in whose gloom the road by
which the hunters entered was soon lost. As the
sun disappeared behind the dense mass of trees the
Duchess eagerly listened for the first peal of the horns
announcing the return. But as the sun sank still
lower and the darkness grew more intense, no peal
sounded from the forest. The wind rustled the
banner above her, then suddenly ceased, and an
ominous silence followed. After a few minutes
the neigh of a horse was heard in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; joyfully exclaimed the
Duchess to her ladies. &ldquo;It is thus my husband&rsquo;s
faithful steed always announces its approach to the
castle. We shall soon hear the signal of the horn,
summoning us to make ready for them. Come,
let us go to meet the Duke in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Followed by her ladies, who cast parting and
anxious glances at the forest, the Duchess hastened
inside, ascended the steep, winding stairs, and entered
the large reception hall, brilliantly illuminated by
torches, where the remaining inmates of the castle
assembled, among them the chaplain in his black
vestments. Uttering the greeting, &ldquo;Peace be with
you,&rdquo; he took his place near the Duchess, the others
arranging themselves in a circle around the walls.
The warder, with his heavy bunch of keys in his
leathern girdle, went out to the courtyard, prepared
to open the outer gate, which was protected by the
drawbridge, when the hunting-party arrived.</p>
<p>At that instant the horn signal was sounded; but
what a mournful tone they heard! All were astonished,
and anxiously looked at the Duchess, who
advanced toward the door with pallid face. Once
again the horn sounded a piercingly mournful call,
and through the outer gate, which the warder had
opened, they saw the party advancing.</p>
<p>A squire was in the advance, leading the Duke&rsquo;s
horse by the bridle. When she saw the horse was
riderless, the Duchess pressed her hand to her heart
but retained her composure; for, if her husband
was injured and needed her care, she must be courageous.
The next to enter the courtyard were the
Duke&rsquo;s followers. With slow and measured step
they carried a covered bier, and silently placed it
in the entrance to the hall. Behind them pressed
knights and hunters, on foot and horse, and much
confusion prevailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Constance seemed to pay no heed to them. She
went to the bier and lifted the covering. There she
saw Geoffrey, her husband&mdash;dead!<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The handsome, noble features in their setting of
luxuriant blond hair, so lately lit up with life and
animation, were now rigid in the chill of death.
Long Constance stood immovable, with the edge of
the covering in her uplifted hand, and gazed with
horror-stricken eyes, as if transformed to stone.</p>
<p>The chaplain tenderly approached her. &ldquo;Gracious
Princess, permit us to conduct you to your
apartments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words broke the silence. She uttered an
exclamation of despair and with a shriek fell fainting
into the arms of her ladies. The chaplain had
her quickly removed to her chamber and cared for,
and then returned to the hall. The knights had
given over their weapons and horses to their servants,
and were assembled there. A low murmur
of hushed voices, mingled with sounds of mourning,
filled the great room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Sir Knight,&rdquo; the chaplain implored of
H&ouml;el of Mordant, Geoffrey&rsquo;s oldest vassal and
friend, who stood by the bier with bowed head,
leaning upon his sword. &ldquo;I know not yet how
this dreadful tragedy occurred. I only realize that
the Duke, whom we saw but a few hours ago in the
flower of his health and strength, is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Several voices were raised to relate the circumstances.
The hunters had had an enjoyable time
until noon, and had slain many stags and boars, but
one huge boar, which the Duke discovered at the
very outset, managed for a long time to elude his
spear. The hounds kept upon its track, and,
guided by their baying, he at last overtook it and
hurled his spear. He only wounded it slightly,
whereupon the infuriated beast turned upon the
Duke&rsquo;s horse and attacked it with its tusks. At
this instant several knights came up, and saw the
Duke draw his hunting-knife, intending to stab the
boar in the neck; but at that moment his horse,
overcome by pain and fear, reared and fell, and in
the fall the knife pierced the Duke&rsquo;s side. He lay
weltering in his blood as his friends gathered around
him, and only once he opened his eyes. They
rested upon Knight H&ouml;el, who knelt by his side.
The sorrowful glance of appeal in Geoffrey&rsquo;s dimming
eyes deeply affected the knight. Raising his
head he thus spoke: &ldquo;Whatever it may be, my
Prince and brother-in-arms, that thou would&rsquo;st ask,
trust me it shall be done. I will devote my loyal
service to the end of my life to thy memory, and
hold it as a sacred trust.&rdquo; The Duke closed his
eyes. A sigh escaped him, and his face was illuminated
with joyous satisfaction. Then they carried
his body home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el, &ldquo;we will execute the last
service for our master. Chaplain, remove the body
to the chapel and perform the sacred rites.&rdquo; Then,
turning to two of the knights, he said: &ldquo;And you,
my friends, keep the death-watch at the bier. I cannot
yet master the sorrow which has overcome me.
I must have time for reflection, for my responsibility
to the ducal house is great. See that the gates are
secure, and station sentinels. In the morning all
must assemble in the hall and have their steeds in
readiness, for messengers must be sent in all directions.
Now, betake yourselves to rest, if you can
find it,&rdquo; he ended with a sigh.</p>
<p>Suddenly cries were heard from above, and some
one said, &ldquo;The Duchess is dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of all the saints at once,&rdquo; groaned
the knight, &ldquo;see to it that she has help!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The chaplain obeyed, but soon returned with the
announcement, &ldquo;Our gracious lady has recovered
and does not need me.&rdquo; Thereupon he motioned
to the squires to take the bier into the chapel, and
followed it. Through the open door the priest was
seen as he advanced to the altar, which was faintly
lit by tapers. In a low voice he began the service.
The mourners remained kneeling for a time during
the sacred ceremony, then gradually withdrew, and
only the murmur of prayer was heard. Priest and
watchers were alone with the dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The New Life</span></h2>
<p>Armed, and with helmet in hand, H&ouml;el
entered the hall at early dawn, only to
find it deserted. The chapel too was
closed, for the chaplain had gone, and
only the knights keeping the death-watch remained.</p>
<p>A page brought the knight a warm drink. He
drained the cup, and as he turned to hand it back
to him he saw the priest descending the stairs which
led to the apartments of the Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen our gracious lady? Then
arrange for my admission also,&rdquo; H&ouml;el said to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come outside with me,&rdquo; replied the chaplain,
much agitated, &ldquo;and hear what I have to say, not
here where we are so near the dead, but under
God&rsquo;s sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overcome with astonishment, H&ouml;el followed the
chaplain as he strode forward in haste to the
courtyard. As they went, a loud trumpet-blast
sounded jubilantly from the battlements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is the warder out of his senses? What means
this fanfare in the house of the dead?&rdquo; exclaimed
H&ouml;el indignantly. &ldquo;And what does that mean
also? The black flag has been lowered on the
watch-tower, and the banner with the arms of the
Plantagenets floats in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means, noble knight,&rdquo; replied the chaplain,
&ldquo;that Brittany has a new Duke,&mdash;our Lady Constance
has a son.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The knight&rsquo;s eyes glistened with delight, but
it was only for an instant. With a sigh he gently
said: &ldquo;Poor Geoffrey! Unfortunate child!&rdquo; Then
he stood for a time in deep thought. &ldquo;All the
same,&rdquo; he said at last, recovering himself, &ldquo;messengers
must carry the double news to all the
castles and cities. The Council of the dead Duke
must send ambassadors to the courts of England
and France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As King Henry is engaged in a campaign
against Scotland and Queen Eleanor passes away
the time among her castles in Guienne, there does
not seem to be urgent need of haste,&rdquo; said the
chaplain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong. They must be informed as
speedily as possible,&rdquo; replied the knight. As he
was in the act of mounting his steed, which a squire
had brought, a page rushed up and summoned him
to the Duchess.</p>
<p>The knight followed the messenger to an upper
room, where one of the maids promptly met him,
and conducted him to a large apartment, against the
rear wall of which the Duchess&rsquo;s bed stood under a
gilded canopy. The curtains were partly drawn
back, and in the half darkness he saw the face of
the Duchess among the silken pillows. H&ouml;el knelt
and awaited her commands. She motioned him to
rise, and said, &ldquo;Show him the child, Joconde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse approached, and lifted the veil from
the little white bundle she was carrying, so that he
might see the child. As he stooped to look at him,
the little one opened its eyes and uttered a faint
cry. The plaintive tone pierced H&ouml;el&rsquo;s heart.
He laid his hand upon the child&rsquo;s head and said
with deep emotion, &ldquo;Accept my homage, son of
my brave lord and friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Duchess bade Joconde retire, and then
said, &ldquo;May all, worthy knight, like yourself, pay
homage to Duke Arthur of Brittany, for it was
this name my husband selected for his first son.&rdquo;
She gave way to her emotions for a moment, and
then said with firm voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this signet ring of my husband&rsquo;s, show
it to the members of the Council at Rennes,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> and
bid them execute my commands. The citizens
of every city shall assemble; and to them and to
every country it shall be proclaimed that Duchess
Constance of Brittany will maintain the ducal
authority, and that during the minority of her son
she will rule all the possessions of the deceased
Duke Geoffrey Plantagenet, with the help of God
and the nobles of Brittany. Send a messenger also
to the King of England and inform him of the
death of his son and the birth of a grandson. But,
above all, send a prudent man with a letter to King
Philip Augustus at Paris.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> Assure the King of our
feudal loyalty as a vassal of France, and tell him
we shall render him our usual service in time of
peace or war, and pay the customary tribute. In
consideration of this he is to assist us in case
of necessity against any enemy of our country or
of the young Duke. Have the letter drawn up in
temperate and friendly tone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, my lady,&rdquo; replied H&ouml;el; &ldquo;and
what are your wishes as to the funeral of the Duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall be buried in the Cathedral at Rennes,
and the chaplain must see that everything necessary
is done. Now go, and God preserve you.
May you quickly return for our protection.&rdquo; She
leaned back, wearied. The curtains were closed,
and the knight left the apartment with a feeling
of relief. When he reached the courtyard he
summoned his people and the chaplain, who inquired
what commissions the Duchess had given
him. He answered curtly, &ldquo;Chaplain, he who
says women are weak and timid has never known
the Duchess Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el, with his hand upon his
horse&rsquo;s bridle, &ldquo;France is the watchword. She said
scarcely a word about England.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Geoffrey&rsquo;s Legacy</span></h2>
<p>Upon his arrival in Rennes, the ancient
capital, H&ouml;el found the citizens greatly
excited over the rumor of the Duke&rsquo;s
death. As his little band rode through
the streets, the people came from their houses and
workshops, and a great multitude gathered round
the castle. They had hardly heard the news of his
death before it was followed by joyful intelligence,
which turned sorrow into rejoicing. Enthusiastic
shouts of &ldquo;Hail to the new-born Duke! Long
live Arthur Plantagenet!&rdquo; rang out on all sides.</p>
<p>The Council and leading ecclesiastics were assembled
when H&ouml;el entered the hall. After exhibiting
the ring and executing his commission, he described
to them the occurrence of the fatal day, but made
no reply to their eager questioning as to the
future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done, Knight Mordant?&rdquo; they
asked. &ldquo;Brittany will remain loyal to the Duke;
but will King Henry of England protect us? Philip
Augustus of France will certainly seek to extend his
possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us do our duty,&rdquo; replied H&ouml;el. &ldquo;We may
accomplish great things if we remain united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short rest H&ouml;el departed, taking a different
route to the hunting-castle, in order to visit
Castle Mordant and see his wife and little son.</p>
<p>He found them very happy and without any
knowledge of what had happened. In a few words
he described the condition of the Duchess to his
wife. &ldquo;And now, Bertha,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;prepare
yourself and little Alan to ride with me. I shall
not feel easy about the Duchess and the child until
I know that you are with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha in surprise drew Alan to her side. &ldquo;Would
you take me to the Duchess without knowing
whether I shall be welcome? The Lady Constance
has not been accustomed to children for years, and
may not like youthful mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not for her sake, Bertha, do it for the child&rsquo;s
sake. Suppose a faithless nurse should place him
under the control of the grandmother, Queen Eleanor
of England, and he should meet with the same fate
as her child, the little girl. What happened to her,
do you ask? They say she was put in a convent.
If Geoffrey&rsquo;s son were to be placed in a monastery,
I believe his father would not rest in his grave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; assented Bertha. &ldquo;Let the child be
intrusted to me, and I will care for it as if it were
my own. His lot, in any event, will be hard enough,
for rulers care little for the rights of minors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that Geoffrey had only been on good terms
with his father!&rdquo; exclaimed H&ouml;el. &ldquo;His participation
in the rebellion into which his mother and
brothers urged him estranged his father&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were reconciled afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but his father&rsquo;s confidence was not restored,
and the others have been subjected to every kind
of injustice. What lies Eleanor told about John,
her youngest son! His father does not trust him,
and has given him no possessions. To save himself
from impoverishment he is casting covetous
glances toward Brittany.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father&rsquo;s share to half the country cannot
be taken away from her,&rdquo; said Bertha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not by right; but might knows no right.
Perhaps, however, the jealousy between France and
England, whose sovereigns will never permit their
beautiful maritime provinces to go to another, may
save us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the name of the little Duke?&rdquo; interrupted
Alan, who had climbed upon his father&rsquo;s
knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is called Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he play with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but perhaps later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After speedy preparations they departed; they
reached the hunting-castle at evening, where they
found the Duchess doing well. Bertha&rsquo;s fears
proved groundless. She was heartily welcomed by
Constance, who was at that moment specially grateful
for any expression of sympathy. The Duchess
well knew that she could not place her son in better
hands, and for the first time she felt free from anxiety
when Bertha cradled him in her faithful arms.
She cared alike for the two children; and Alan, far
from being jealous because his mother shared her
love between them, displayed the utmost tenderness
to the little Duke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>H&ouml;el was now free to devote himself to the sad
duty of burying the dead. A great concourse of
knights, citizens, and ecclesiastics accompanied the
body of the Duke to Rennes in an imposing procession,
headed by H&ouml;el and the chaplain. All along
the road they passed sorrowing people. Serious
anxiety for the future filled all hearts, and sincere
mourning followed the Duke to his grave.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter the Duchess and her nearest
attendants betook themselves to the capital, and
were greeted with loyal homage. She met with no
protests or opposition. Her regency was indorsed,
and all the rights which Geoffrey had enjoyed in
the English provinces were conceded. H&ouml;el remained
steadfastly by the side of the Duchess and
devoted himself exclusively to her service. His example,
and his tender consideration for her, worked
for her advantage, as it induced many who were
wavering at first to join in making the recognition
of her authority unanimous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Embassy</span></h2>
<p>As the Duchess was obliged to devote the
most of her time to affairs of state, the
child was tenderly cared for by Bertha.
The quiet of the little court was broken
by the festivities attending the approaching christening
of the Duke. Tournaments and sports were
arranged, and the friends and adherents of the
Duchess were summoned to Rennes. She had received
no tidings from the relatives of her husband,
whereas King Philip Augustus of France had
promised to be represented by one of his knights,
whose arrival was eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>At last the French gentlemen appeared at the
gate of the castle in imposing array&mdash;knights in
glistening armor, squires and servants also armed.
Count von Gragny, a famous soldier and well-known
to H&ouml;el on many a battle-field, came as the
King&rsquo;s representative. The strangers were escorted
to their quarters, and after a short rest Count
Gragny exchanged his armor for court dress to
wait upon the Duchess. With his little retinue he
rode through the narrow streets of the city to the
castle, where the chamberlain conducted him to her
presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Constance received upon a dais in the centre
of the room, surrounded by her ladies, and bowed
a gracious welcome to the Count, who knelt and
delivered the greeting of his King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted, noble Count,&rdquo; Constance began,
&ldquo;that the King has granted my wish and is
willing to be the godfather of the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King has shown you further favor, Lady
Duchess, and has intrusted me with a message
which is for your private ear,&rdquo; replied the Count.</p>
<p>The Duchess, surprised, motioned her ladies to
withdraw. &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; she eagerly exclaimed, when
they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King of France, in consideration of your
unprotected situation and the dangers which threaten
the heir of Duke Geoffrey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; interrupted Constance, &ldquo;we do
not feel that we are unprotected. Our vassals are
faithful, and the people are loyal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet as dangers may easily arise, noble lady,
when you least expect them, King Philip offers to
undertake the guardianship of your son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Constance was alarmed, but retained her composure,
and asked: &ldquo;Would not this provoke danger?
It is the duty of the nearest paternal relatives, the
King of England and his princes, to take the place
of father to my son, and they may not yield that
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure they are willing to exercise it,
Lady Duchess? and have you sufficient confidence
in them to intrust your child to their care? Will
they unqualifiedly recognize him as the Duke?
King Henry is far over the frontiers of Scotland
and his sons are not on the best of terms with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard is noble and just. He is the eldest, and
is under obligation to his dead brother, Geoffrey,&rdquo;
replied Constance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not depend upon him. He is never in one
place long enough to become attached to any one.
I advise you to accept the King&rsquo;s offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will consider it, Count,&rdquo; replied the Duchess,
rising. &ldquo;For the next few days, meanwhile, you
are my guest. We will let business rest during the
festivities, but will confer with you again on this
matter before you return to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The Count bowed and left the Duchess, who
remained for some time absorbed in thought. At
last she called Bertha, who was accustomed to bring
the Prince to his mother about that hour, and she
at once entered, carrying the child in her arms.
The Duchess rushed up to her, took the child, and
tenderly kissed him. &ldquo;I may enjoy my sweet one
only a moment to-day, Bertha,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Is it not glorious that God has given me such a
charming gift of love? Surely fate should be kind
to him, but, alas, clouds are gathering on the horizon
of his life, and I am left alone to protect him.
Now, Bertha, take my darling away, for Knight
H&ouml;el comes to speak with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H&ouml;el was very anxious, for he feared, after the
long interview with the Count, that difficulties had
arisen. Constance began at once communicating to
him what had been proposed, &ldquo;Can you divine
what King Philip Augustus has requested of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Requested, or demanded?&rdquo; asked H&ouml;el.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both, only the demand was concealed. He
wishes to take the guardianship of the Duke of
Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! crafty as ever! Were his proposal disinterested,
it would be well. Still, Philip has the
power to protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;But against whom? We are living in peace, and
I must first know what to expect from England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I know what reply you made to the
Count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, as yet. I asked time for consideration.
See to it, therefore, that the French gentlemen have
a cordial reception, and at the christening to-morrow
the representative of the King shall be honored as
far as is in our power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this the Duchess closed the interview, and
H&ouml;el repaired to his guests to ascertain their wishes
and make their visit as pleasant as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Christening</span></h2>
<p>The little Duke was christened Arthur, as
his father had decided. After the ceremony
was concluded and he had been
taken back to his chamber and consigned
to Bertha&rsquo;s care, the Duchess summoned all her
guests, as well as her knights and ecclesiastics, to a
feast in the great hall. Constance was seated at the
head of the table, under a canopy. The strangers,
with whom she graciously conversed in French, sat
near her, while the guests at the lower end of the
table spoke in the native Breton dialect. Quiet at
first, they gradually grew more animated as great
flagons of wine were repeatedly filled and drained.
Owing to the confusion in the hall they failed to
hear the sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs outside the castle,
and the blast of a horn was the first announcement
they had of the arrival of new guests. The chamberlain
entered the hall and whispered to the Duchess,
who thereupon rose, and with a wave of her hand
ordered silence. &ldquo;We have unexpectedly been
honored by the arrival of a noble visitor,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;It is Queen Eleanor. She is at the castle with her
retinue. Let us hasten to receive them with the
honors due to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Constance advanced to the entrance of the hall,
followed by her nobles, a part of the guests remaining
at table. Scarcely had she reached it when the
Queen met her at the head of several knights.</p>
<p>With stately dignity Constance courtesied her
greeting and spoke: &ldquo;Welcome, illustrious Queen!
and excuse us for not going out to receive you.
We are surprised, having received no intimation
of this visit, although we sent messengers with
invitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen stretched out her hand to Constance
and kissed her on the forehead. &ldquo;We have changed
the route of the journey we had planned to greet
you, daughter-in-law, and are truly delighted to find
you so strong and well. We were ready to sympathize
with you in your affliction, but it does not
appear to be necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honored mother of my dead husband, I shall
never cease to mourn for Geoffrey; but you very
well know that princesses have no time to abandon
themselves to grief. But come and participate in
our feast. You will find worthy guests here, messengers
from the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Queen, as she
recognized Count Gragny, who with the others
advanced and bowed low. &ldquo;Have you settled
matters so far as to throw yourself already into the
arms of Philip Augustus, even before you have
taken the trouble to ascertain the policy of the
King of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I have received no answer to my
message to England,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;I doubt
not that King Henry will approve my action in
securing the good-will of our powerful neighbor and
seeking his protection for my son, the Duke of
Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see the child,&rdquo; replied Eleanor. As she
noticed Constance looking inquiringly at H&ouml;el, she
added: &ldquo;Why do you hesitate? Have you any
reason for concealing him from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>H&ouml;el went at once to notify Bertha, and when
the Queen entered the chamber with Count Gragny
and several other knights, all gathered about the
cradle in which the child was lying. Eleanor gave
one glance at the little Duke and then turned again
to Constance. &ldquo;I advise you to give up your game.
I shall never recognize this boy as Geoffrey&rsquo;s heir.
Content yourself with your paternal possessions in
Brittany, which I shall never enter again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Your Majesty?&rdquo; exclaimed
Constance, with increasing emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that the heir came very suddenly, and
when he was greatly needed,&rdquo; said Eleanor. &ldquo;Who
knows in what hut he was born and found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is monstrous!&rdquo; interrupted Constance.
&ldquo;How dare you impute such a disgraceful thing
to me, and insult me in my most sacred relations?
Go! Only one who can invent such a story is capable
of such action. You have a wicked heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;See to it that you
and your child do not come in my way, otherwise woe
to him and to you.&rdquo; As she said this she made a
threatening gesture with her hand at the child.</p>
<p>Little Alan, who had been standing by his
mother&rsquo;s side, darted forward and, seizing the
Queen&rsquo;s arm, cried out in his shrill childish voice,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you touch the Duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen regarded Alan with astonishment,
and said with a sneer: &ldquo;So! You have taught
young and old to call him Duke without regard
to the policy of others!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;The united dukedom belongs to us as rightfully
as does Guienne, which you inherited from your
father, to you,&rdquo; said Constance haughtily. &ldquo;But
now, Your Majesty, let us have peace. Remember,
you are our guest, and as such we shall treat you
with due honor.&rdquo; The Duchess stepped to the
door, and stood there until Eleanor had passed,
then followed with her knights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a woman!&rdquo; whispered Count Gragny to
H&ouml;el, who quietly shrugged his shoulders. He
kept his eyes bent upon the Queen, as he suspected
she might have communication with those near the
Duchess, for he feared her wiles. Eleanor took
very little part in the banquet, and shortly retired
with her attendants, after a brief leave-taking.</p>
<p>Those remaining in the hall regarded each other
in silence, but Count Gragny could not long endure
the situation. He spoke out: &ldquo;The Queen came
like the bad fairy who always appears unexpectedly
at christenings. Fortunately, she left no evil gift
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, noble Count,&rdquo; replied H&ouml;el, &ldquo;she has left
us anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us drown all thoughts of troublesome questions
with mirth and wine,&rdquo; exclaimed the Count,
raising his glass. &ldquo;Your Ladyship, I drink to the
health of Duke Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance gracefully thanked him for the honor,
and raised her glass to her lips. After that she
announced the close of the feast and dismissed the
guests.</p>
<p>She hastened at once to her child. She knelt
down by his cradle and looked for a long time at the
handsome little one lying in quiet slumber, watched
his gentle breathing, and admired his rosy cheeks.
Alan stood at the head of the cradle and kept watch
over his Duke. With a sad smile Constance rose,
took Bertha&rsquo;s hand, and left the chamber.</p>
<p>Later in the evening the Duchess, H&ouml;el, and her
counsellors prepared a reply to King Philip&rsquo;s proposals.
It had already been demonstrated by the
Queen&rsquo;s conduct how little they could expect from
her husband&rsquo;s family; for although as wife and
mother Eleanor neither loved nor respected King
Henry and his sons, she understood how to gain
her own ends and embitter the feelings of others.
Could affection for the child be expected of them
when even his own grandmother would not acknowledge
him? After due consideration it was decided
to accept the guardianship offered by Philip Augustus
on condition that the King of England, on his return
from the wars, agreed to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>On the following day Constance gave her reply
to Count Gragny, who expressed his delight, for he
knew that the King would be pleased with the
prompt and successful manner in which he had executed
the commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My King ordered me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to make
arrangements for your safety at once. He will send
you all the troops you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not at war,&rdquo; replied Constance, &ldquo;and
consequently do not need help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Eleanor has been here, Princess, do
not expect that peace will be lasting. The help
offered to-day may be too far away in time of danger
to rescue your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance was deeply impressed by his importunity,
and turned to H&ouml;el, saying: &ldquo;You know
best our means of defence. Do you think them
sufficient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The militia will not hesitate to take the field for
you,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;but only so long as war
may last. Paid troops will remain all the time in
your service, but of course they will be a burden
upon the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a small number will be sent,&rdquo; said the
Count. &ldquo;That is the King&rsquo;s own stipulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance was forced to accept, but with a sad
heart, and dismissed the Count, who at once started
for home with his attendants. The merrymaking
arranged by the Count continued in Rennes, and
the Duchess took part in it with apparent pleasure.
But, as often as she could, she visited the room
where Arthur played upon Bertha&rsquo;s lap and crowed
and laughed in play with Alan. She pressed her
darling to her heart and sighed, &ldquo;It is all for you,
my son, all for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Guardianship</span></h2>
<p>Not long after these events Philip&rsquo;s troops
marched into Brittany, where they met
with a quiet reception; but when they
attempted to establish themselves in
Normandy, they encountered violent resistance.
The powerful barons there had made a complete
surrender to the English government. They had
accepted Geoffrey as its representative and had submitted
to him, but they would not recognize Constance,
for before her departure to England Eleanor
had won them over to her side. Their followers
were well armed, and stoutly resisted the French
troops. In the numerous encounters which occurred
the interests of the Duke of Brittany were
no longer considered. The stake was the mastery
of England or of France, and one or the other side
alternately gained the upper hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>It was still quiet in Brittany, and in Constance&rsquo;s
vicinity H&ouml;el and his men kept good watch. Longingly
and often the Duchess gazed at the child in
her arms and wished that he could soon be a man
to fight with sword in hand for her and her rights.
Thus they were living in apparent security at the
castle in Rennes, but really in continual fear of
approaching dangers. The times were troublous,
and the world was full of disquiet, but Arthur passed
his days pleasantly, in an atmosphere of love. Life
was all smiles for him. Under Bertha&rsquo;s care and
H&ouml;el&rsquo;s devotion he became both gentle and courageous,
and as he grew stronger nothing delighted
him more than rivalry with Alan in all knightly
practices. The latter, older and stronger, was not
only attached to the young Duke by friendship, but
by duty and devotion, and thus became both his
companion and protector. They were inseparable,
and shared everything in common. They roamed
the woods and fields together with all the joyous
enthusiasm of youth, but their greatest longing was
to perform heroic feats. They were much more
delighted to listen to H&ouml;el as he told them of his
adventures and exploits at arms than to the chaplain,
who was their instructor. With rapt attention
they heard the story of how H&ouml;el and Duke Geoffrey
rode together to Normandy and other provinces,
overcame the haughty barons, stormed their strong
castles, and sent them to England to pay fresh
homage to the King. Arthur longed to be such a
hero, and his dearest wish was to assist his mother
in the restoration of the ancient authority. Combining
boldness and gentleness, he was specially fitted
to rule, and it was his greatest pride that he was
entitled to the position of ruler by birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Arthur was in his tenth year when the report
reached them that King Henry&rsquo;s sons, incited by
Eleanor, had conspired to prevent his return from
Scotland. Unexpectedly, however, he suddenly appeared
in England and frustrated their plot. The
news disquieted Constance so greatly that she sent
H&ouml;el for information. He had been absent several
days, and his return was now eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>One evening the Duchess was looking from her
window, which commanded an extended view of the
city and its vicinity. Fatigued with riding and hunting,
Arthur had sought his mother, and was resting
his head upon her shoulder. She turned to him
and stroked his heated brow. Bertha and Alan
were also present, and the room was very quiet.
Suddenly Bertha stepped to the window and exclaimed,
&ldquo;There comes my husband with a stranger.&rdquo;
The two rapidly drew near, and dismounted in the
castle-yard, whence, seeing the ladies at the window,
H&ouml;el came to their apartment. Bertha and the boys
met him in the anteroom, at the door of which stood
the Duchess. &ldquo;What news do you bring?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news,&rdquo; replied H&ouml;el. &ldquo;King Henry is
dead.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The Duchess silently motioned to the knight to
enter, and seated herself. After Bertha had taken
the boys away, H&ouml;el began: &ldquo;The King died of a
broken heart, so the people say. He could not
endure the thought that the Queen had plotted his
overthrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&mdash;and the Princes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard threw himself at his father&rsquo;s feet and
begged forgiveness. Prince John, on the other
hand, hypocritically sought to clear himself of
guilt. But the King knew only too well. &lsquo;All
three sons,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> he groaned, and fell unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance started, and H&ouml;el was silent. Yes,
the third one was Geoffrey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;And did he die at once? Did he leave no
instructions concerning the kingdom? Had he no
thought for Geoffrey&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; asked the Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say he longed for his grandson and
mourned because he had not been able to see him.
He drew up his will and placed it in the keeping
of the Lord High Chancellor. Then he turned
his thoughts to divine things, took the sacrament,
and passed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance was silent for some time, then asked,
&ldquo;And does any one know the contents of the
will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sealed up in the royal exchequer and
can be opened only in case the Prince&mdash;no, King
Richard&mdash;shall die childless. Only the confidential
witnesses know its contents,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>King</i> Richard!&rdquo; replied Constance. &ldquo;God be
thanked it is Richard who has come to the throne.
He is noble and high-minded, and will protect us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant it! Would that he could soon come
to France and restore order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence came the rider who brought the
news?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;From Rouen. English vessels have landed
there, and brought Norman knights who were in the
Scottish campaign. They will guard the country
until he can come himself and take possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as King Richard comes to Rouen, we
will seek him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el, &ldquo;I will make ample
preparations to insure your safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not shameful,&rdquo; said Constance indignantly,
&ldquo;that the Duchess of Brittany should be insecure
in her own country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>H&ouml;el was awaited in the hall by the two boys,
who plied him with questions. The death of
King Henry made a deep impression upon Arthur,
who already realized that his fate had rested in his
grandfather&rsquo;s hands. For the first time also he
realized the insecurity of human greatness, and
when suddenly the bells tolled in the city&rsquo;s church
towers, and the castle chapel bell added its solemn
peals, he was greatly overcome, and held fast to
Alan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Journey</span></h2>
<p>It was a beautiful summer morning, and the hills
and valleys of Brittany were flooded with sunlight.
All Nature seemed exultant, and all living
things were sharing her transports. The
beauty of the fields and green woods concealed alike
all traces of the last winter&rsquo;s storms and the ravages
so often occasioned by men when they sow the earth
with fire and blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>As if still more to enhance the beauty of the scene,
a cavalcade was seen approaching from the adjacent
wooded heights. The riders followed the winding
road, now in groups, now singly, and sometimes
were entirely hidden from view. Clear, ringing
voices, joyous laughter, and now and then deep
manly voices mingled with the neighing of horses.
The travellers were the Duchess of Brittany, her
son, and attendants. The seneschal rode in advance
with two heralds, followed by Constance in a riding-habit
of green silk, mounted upon a beautiful palfrey.
H&ouml;el rode by her side, his fiery bay taking the lead
whenever the road narrowed, to make room for the
Duchess&rsquo;s horse. Then came Duke Arthur and
Alan on prancing black steeds. Arthur sat jauntily
yet securely in his saddle, his slight figure being a
trifling burden for the noble animal, which seemed
to take pride in carrying him. He looked boyish
yet distinguished. His unusual beauty was a sufficient
mark of his high birth even if his costume had
not proclaimed it. He wore a cloak of brown silk
embroidered with gold, and over it a short, dark
satin mantle tipped with ermine. From his cap
waved a heron plume, fastened with jewels. He
was a figure of beauty as he rode through the
charming world about him, engaged in earnest talk
with Alan. Behind the youths followed the squires
and troopers, next the Duchess&rsquo;s ladies, and in the
rear the servants with the sumpter horses. It was
an imposing though not a warlike train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Their destination was Rouen, where King Richard
had arrived, not, as Constance had hoped, to settle
her affairs, but to consult with Philip Augustus about
the Crusade.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
It was all the more urgent, therefore,
for the Duchess to seek an interview with him and
ascertain his plans before he entered upon such a
long and dangerous journey. The King had been
notified of her visit and had arranged for her safe
passage through Normandy, whose frontier she was
now approaching. As they emerged from the woods
H&ouml;el heard a cry and the sound of a struggle in a
thicket close at hand, and ordered a halt. Before
he began an investigation, the disturbers of the
peace appeared. Two men were dragging another
along, answering his appeals with blows and abusive
epithets. The victim was an old man, and the sight
aroused Arthur&rsquo;s indignation. He rode up at once,
and ordered the men to give an account of their
conduct, and in the meantime to release the old man.
The latter fell upon his knees and looked up to
Arthur with tearful eyes. H&ouml;el and Alan came
forward and heard the indignant protest of the two
men. They declared they were bailiffs in the service
of the King of France. &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; they
said, pointing to the kneeling victim, &ldquo;is a Jew.
The last day of grace King Philip allowed the Jews
has expired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; asked Arthur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The old man looked up and said: &ldquo;Listen, most
gracious Prince, for, although I know you not, I
can see the reflection of the crown upon your brow.
Yes, it is true. The great King Philip Augustus,
although he has long allowed our race to live in
his kingdom, has now set his face against us. He
has said, &lsquo;Take the staff and leave the country;
any one of you found in France after the day
which I set shall die.&rsquo; The King&rsquo;s servants have
hounded us. They have plundered our homes;
they have driven off our poor and wretched people.
I was on my way to Holland, where our people
have freedom to live, but I was so overcome by
grief and hunger that I had to stay in the city
until to-day&mdash;and now they have caught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks bad for you, Jew,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>The bailiffs were again about to seize their prisoner,
but Arthur cried: &ldquo;Stop! Let him go free.
It is my wish that he shall accompany us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the King&rsquo;s servants,&rdquo; demurred the
bailiffs, &ldquo;and must obey his orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in command here, not King Philip,&rdquo; said
Arthur boldly and proudly. &ldquo;I am the Duke of
Brittany. Take yourselves off, or my men shall
bind you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The bailiffs, astonished at the delicate boy, who
spoke with such dignity, lost no time in getting
away.</p>
<p>The Jew, when he realized that he was free,
bowed to the earth before Arthur and kissed his
feet. The old man was so tattered, befouled,
and ill-favored that Arthur had some scruples
about addressing him, but at last he said, &ldquo;If I
protect you as far as Rouen will you then take
ship to Holland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man consented, saying, &ldquo;God will
help me on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur gave him one of the packhorses, whose
load was distributed among the other animals, and
ordered the servants to let him ride with them.
More quickly than might have been expected of
one so weak, the Jew swung himself into the
saddle and joined the little band, which once more
resumed its march.</p>
<p>Constance took no part in the occurrence, and
when Arthur rode up and entreated her approval
of his act she said to him with some anxiety,
&ldquo;When the bailiffs complain to Philip he may be
angry with you, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Arthur became thoughtful as H&ouml;el added, &ldquo;The
life of this Jew is of little consequence to Philip, for
whatever he has of value the King will be sure to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dispersal of the Jews was ordered to
please the Pope,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el, &ldquo;and out of their
wealth King Philip will raise the means for arming
the Crusaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not kingly,&rdquo; said Arthur indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same they are Jews, and their treasures
will be taken for the King&rsquo;s service. How can it
harm them anyway? They exude gold as these
pines do pitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur reflected upon H&ouml;el&rsquo;s words with considerable
surprise and almost regretted his display
of sympathy. But when he looked back and saw
the bent figure of the Jew following the others,
who shunned him, he thought to himself, &ldquo;Still, I
could not let him perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the Duchess and her most distinguished
companions stopped at one of the stately
abbeys of that region, and Arthur arranged that the
Jew should spend the night with the servants who
looked after the horses outside. They had soon
become accustomed to their silent fellow-traveller,
who served them for a laughing-stock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>After the fourth day the travellers at last approached
their destination. They met crowds
along the country road&mdash;haughty knights, warriors,
and pilgrims intending to take part in the
expedition to Palestine, besides ecclesiastics and
monks, traders and shopkeepers. It was a good-natured
crowd, but it often obstructed our travellers,
and at times they were separated from each other.
Arthur and Alan were frequently delayed by a
group going in the opposite direction; then, laughing
and shouting, they rejoined their party. But
toward evening H&ouml;el decided to ride faster, so that
they might reach the city before the gates closed.
The party got more closely together, and H&ouml;el rode
along the line, urging on both people and horses.
While thus engaged he discovered that the Jew was
no longer with them, and that the horse he had been
riding was quietly following the others. H&ouml;el caught
it by the bridle and looked about him to see if he
were not mistaken. As he was doing so he noticed a
piece of paper tied to the saddle, with a ring attached
to it. He untied it and hastened to the Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ward has flown,&rdquo; began H&ouml;el.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Then he is both false and ungrateful,&rdquo;
said the Duke, in some confusion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; replied H&ouml;el. &ldquo;He has left
the horse and this&mdash;see here.&rdquo; He handed his
find to Arthur, who took the ring from the paper
with much surprise. Upon the billet was written
in Latin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Duke of Brittany, in gratitude for saving
his life.&mdash;Abraham of Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ring was a heavy gold one with a magnificent
emerald set in it. Arthur twirled it about, delighted
with its brilliancy, then put it on his finger and placed
the paper in his cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abraham of Paris,&rdquo; repeated the Duchess
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I well remember that name. He
is called the richest of the Paris Jews. The King
often bade him come to the court, and purchased
jewels of him, and when he needed money Abraham
furnished it; but I wish nothing to be said about
our meeting him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">King Richard in Rouen</span></h2>
<p>After brief delay at the gate, the travellers
were admitted and escorted to the
place selected for them. As Constance
was anxious to meet the King at once,
she sent word to the seneschal and followed him to
the castle, accompanied by Arthur, H&ouml;el, and Alan.
A marshal met them near the entrance and called
a servant to aid them in dismounting. There was
in the courtyard such a crowd of knights, pages, and
court people of various ranks that they made slow
progress. Arthur paid little attention to the brilliant
rooms through which they passed or to the persons
who occupied them. His thoughts were fixed upon
one object&mdash;to see Richard, his uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The marshal bade H&ouml;el and Alan wait in the
great hall, where two halberdiers kept guard, and
then beckoned to a page and ordered him to wait
upon the Duchess. The page disappeared behind a
door, which he almost immediately reopened. Stepping
back into an anteroom, he left the guests free
to enter. With rapidly beating heart Arthur crossed
the threshold, following his mother, and found himself
in a spacious apartment, at the upper end of
which King Richard rose from a carven arm-chair
and advanced to meet the Duchess.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> Arthur almost
cried out when he saw the figure of the King before
him, just as he had always imagined him to look,
only more stately. The grandeur about him affected
him but little, for his gaze was riveted upon
the face of the King, which revealed dignity joined
with strength and goodness, and upon those eyes
which beamed so mildly upon his friends and
flashed so terribly upon his enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>He greeted the Duchess cordially, took her hand,
and said: &ldquo;It is long, dear sister-in-law, since we
met, and we have passed through great sorrows.
But you have had one consolation,&rdquo; he added,
placing his hand upon Arthur&rsquo;s shoulder. Arthur
took the King&rsquo;s other hand and kissed it. King
Richard invited his guests to be seated and took his
place between them. Then he looked at Arthur
again, murmuring to himself, &ldquo;Geoffrey! Geoffrey!&rdquo;
Tears filled the Duchess&rsquo;s eyes as Richard continued:
&ldquo;We loved each other dearly. Geoffrey was less
impulsive, and restrained me from committing many
a rash act, but he stood by me to the last. Do you
know, Lady Constance, when I was engaged in that
unfortunate revolt against my father, how I came to
you alone in the darkness of night, pursued by his
soldiers? They demanded me as their prisoner, but
Geoffrey would not surrender me, and we beat our
assailants back from the walls. Geoffrey surely
saved his brother, but in doing so he was in rebellion
against his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this conversation Arthur was lost in
contemplation of his uncle. Even without armor
Richard was the ideal of a hero. He was the incomparable
knight who in every tournament dashed
horse and rider into the dust; for whom no foe
was too strong, no fortress too secure, and who,
after his victories, sang in competition with the
troubadours.</p>
<p>A smile lit up Richard&rsquo;s face as he noticed the
boy&rsquo;s rapt gaze, and, turning suddenly, he asked,
&ldquo;What are you thinking about, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; replied Arthur with a start&mdash;&ldquo;oh,
I was thinking that my father could not
help standing by you. As brother and as knight
he could not have done otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Richard, looking at the red cross
fastened upon his left shoulder, &ldquo;the Church now
demands that I shall go to the Holy Land and
make expiation for my resistance to my father&rsquo;s
authority. I have promised to go, and shall keep
my word, though it is hard to leave my kingdom,
which is not yet quieted. Oh, Arthur, if you were
only a man and could fight by my side! There
is glory still to be acquired in the morning-land for
him who is victor under the banner of Godfrey of
Bouillon,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> and the celestial crown of the martyr for
him who falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly excited by Richard&rsquo;s words, Arthur fell
upon his knees, exclaiming, &ldquo;I will go with you,
my uncle and my king: I will be your page, your
servant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance stretched out her hand as if to restrain
him, but Richard said with a quiet smile: &ldquo;No,
Arthur; wait until you have come to a man&rsquo;s
strength. There will be great deeds for you to
perform later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Arthur and the Duchess rose to take leave of the
King, who embraced her, saying: &ldquo;As you may be
in need of rest, I will not detain you longer, but
I will receive you again to-morrow as my guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King struck a shield hanging upon the wall,
whereupon two pages and the marshal entered, and
under their respectful escort the Duchess and Duke
left the castle after they had been rejoined by H&ouml;el
and Alan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Banquet</span></h2>
<p>On the following day Arthur saw Richard
in the midst of his brilliant and warlike
retinue. The Duchess sat at the table
next to the King, with Arthur by her side.
Famous men, knights, statesmen, and ecclesiastics
had seats below the Duke, who was quite elated
because his rank placed him next the King. Their
greetings reminded him that he must prove himself
worthy of them by his own merit and heroic deeds,
and a new world was revealed to him as he listened
to the words of these men of wide experience, though
he but half understood them. Many a one noticed
the enthusiasm of the boy, and his high-bred mien,
and was charmed by him. When King Richard
raised his glass to drink the health of his sister-in-law,
the Duchess Constance, the guests joyously
responded, and added, &ldquo;Long live Duke Arthur
of Brittany!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Greatly excited, Arthur rose to thank them, and,
turning to Richard, exclaimed, &ldquo;I will prove myself,
my royal uncle, worthy of the honor paid me by
these brave men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His admirers gathered about him enthusiastically,
spoke of his great and brilliant future, and
praised him as a true scion of the Plantagenets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear, Alan?&rdquo; he said to his devoted
friend, when at last they were alone in their room;
&ldquo;I am destined to achieve fame and greatness. I
shall no longer be content to lead a quiet, unknown
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All who came to know the Prince held him in the
highest esteem, and were surprised that so noble
a youth had developed in comparative obscurity.
Many thought that King Richard might be childless,
and that he was going to a distant war which
would be full of danger. In that case the next
heir to the English throne was Arthur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Hardly a word passed about Constance&rsquo;s affairs
and H&ouml;el&rsquo;s solicitude. Richard referred her to
King Philip as soon as he should arrive; and when
Constance, greatly embarrassed, asked, &ldquo;Are you
angry because we accepted his protection in a time
of need?&rdquo; Richard replied, &ldquo;I do not blame you;
you had to have him for a friend, for England left
you in the lurch. My mother&mdash;&rdquo; Here the King
broke off abruptly, and then closed by saying, &ldquo;I
think everything will be arranged by Philip. Arthur,
of course, will keep Geoffrey&rsquo;s possessions, not only
because of respect for the dead, but also for our love
of his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a week, which to Arthur passed like a
pleasant hour, King Philip arrived in Rouen. His
principal counsellors and several high ecclesiastics
were in his retinue, but not so many soldiers as in
that of Richard.</p>
<p>Arthur was present at the first meeting of the two
sovereigns, and Philip&rsquo;s searching glance discovered
him even before Richard introduced them. At the
words, &ldquo;My cousin and ward,&rdquo; Philip stooped and
kissed his forehead. When Arthur, greatly moved
by his cordiality of manner, greeted him as the protector
of his childhood, Philip&rsquo;s serious face was
illuminated with a gracious smile, revealing the
favorable impression the Duke had made upon
him. He had always sought the control of the
Duke of Brittany to hold England in check, but
now he so unexpectedly found Arthur such an engaging
personality that he determined not to lose
sight of him. He called upon Constance and renewed
his assurances of friendship. When she
expressed some anxiety lest, in the absence of the
two kings, she might be troubled by Eleanor, who
was to remain in England as regent, Philip invited
her to go to his court. &ldquo;You and your son,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;shall be under my feudal protection; and
should you have any fear for your personal safety,
you can be sure of an honorable reception in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Constance expressed her thanks in Richard&rsquo;s presence,
hoping he would make a still closer claim
to Arthur; but the Crusade monopolized all his
thoughts. He had already recognized Brittany as
the hereditary fief which would belong to Arthur
when he came of age, and with this assurance Constance
had to be content.</p>
<p>The departure of King Richard well-nigh broke
Arthur&rsquo;s heart, and Richard embraced him with
deep emotion. Philip admonished them again to
go to Paris whenever it seemed best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will yet happen,&rdquo; said H&ouml;el to Alan on
their way back. &ldquo;Philip well knows that fate will
force Arthur into his arms. Had Richard thought
more of the future, we should not have been going
home thus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Return to Rennes</span></h2>
<p>The friendly reception which the young
Duke everywhere met as he re&euml;ntered
Brittany made the home-coming very
dear to him. The situation had changed,
as he now realized, and the people had great expectations
of his future. When he came to the
gates of cities, the people went out to meet him
with welcomes and good wishes. Arthur showed
interest and kindness for all, and the Duchess gave
him precedence everywhere and rejoiced at the
enthusiasm manifested for him, both by high and
by low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Upon their arrival at Rennes they received sad
news. Bertha was no more. She had died after
a brief illness. It was the first real sorrow in
Arthur&rsquo;s life, and his grief was hardly less than
that of H&ouml;el and Alan, who felt as if their happiness
were forever lost. It separated Arthur&rsquo;s
present life from his past life, and served to concentrate
his thoughts upon the future. All the
news from the great world, into which he had had
a brief glance, now became of interest to him,
especially everything concerning the Crusade. As
time passed, wandering pilgrims and minstrels
came and told of events in the morning-land,&mdash;of
Richard&rsquo;s exploits before Acre and Ascalon,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> and
of his heroic conduct in times of danger, which had
won for him the name of &ldquo;Lion-hearted.&rdquo; Then
news ceased to come for a long time; but suddenly
the report spread that Philip Augustus had returned
to France with only a remnant of his army.
It seemed incredible at first, but they soon found
that it was true, for the Duchess received a letter
from Paris in which Philip urgently requested her
to come there with Arthur. She hesitated, however,
for her safety in Brittany was not imperilled. The
King&rsquo;s letter surprised them all, particularly Arthur,
who had a presentiment that it foreshadowed a
turning-point in his life.</p>
<p>One evening a pilgrim appeared at the castle
gate and desired to speak with the Duke. The
latter had just returned from the chase and was
standing in the anteroom as the stranger entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rest yourself, holy man,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and
then tell me your errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to speak with you in private,&rdquo;
replied the pilgrim. After Arthur had dismissed
those standing about, the pilgrim whispered a few
words to him.</p>
<p>Hardly had he done so before Arthur made a
loud outcry, and rushed into the terrified Duchess&rsquo;s
apartment, exclaiming, &ldquo;Richard is a prisoner!&rdquo; As
he knew nothing more about it, the Duchess, after
summoning H&ouml;el, had the pilgrim brought to her,
and asked him for the particulars. As soon as
the latter removed his palmer&rsquo;s hat, H&ouml;el recognized
him as Count Guntram, one of the Crusaders
in Richard&rsquo;s army. After the first greetings he
told, at Arthur&rsquo;s request, the story of the events
which led to the abandonment of Palestine. Forsaken
by his allies, whom he had alienated by his
haughtiness of manner, Richard realized when it was
too late that he could not rescue Jerusalem with his
army alone. He withdrew reluctantly from the Holy
City, and decided to return. His vessel was separated
from the others and wrecked upon the Italian
coast. Too impatient to wait for the rest of the
fleet, he undertook to retreat with a few companions.
As they had to traverse a hostile country,
they adopted the garb of pilgrims, but they could
not elude the sharp scrutiny of spies. Richard
fell into the hands of the Duke of Austria, whom
he had greatly offended during the Crusade, and the
Duke consigned his distinguished prisoner to Henry
the Sixth, Emperor of Germany.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> His fugitive
companions were making their way to their homes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Arthur, completely absorbed in Richard&rsquo;s fate,
contemplated plans for his deliverance, and had no
doubt that all the princes would unite with him to
rescue the prisoner. Guntram, however, gloomily
shook his head, and said: &ldquo;Richard is imprisoned
in the strong castle of Trifels<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> on the Rhine, and
there he will remain until he is released for a heavy
ransom. Think rather about yourself and your
own affairs, noble Prince. Your Uncle John, hoping
that Richard will never return, is preparing
to attack Brittany and get you into his power as
soon as possible. Make your escape at once, lest
all the noble scions of the house of Plantagenet
fall, and John remain, to the misfortune of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Knight Guntram frequently repeated his warning
before he left the Duchess&rsquo;s court, and the impression
it made upon his hearers was soon strengthened
by indications of its truth.</p>
<p>The country gradually began to grow restless
and excited. The coast-dwellers removed into the
interior, for English vessels had been seen, and
they feared a landing. A letter also was received
from Queen Eleanor, in which the Duchess was
warned not to make any claims upon England for
her son&rsquo;s rights, as they would not be recognized.
In the event of Richard&rsquo;s death, John, who was
now sharing the sovereignty with Eleanor, would
certainly succeed to the throne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>In view of the manifest danger to the Duke&rsquo;s
rights it was decided that they must seek the
protection and help of Philip Augustus. Accompanied
by their nearest and most devoted attendants,
Duchess Constance and Arthur once more set out,
this time upon an eventful journey. Mourning
over the fate of their country and their own fate
as well, they left their beloved Brittany. Hardly
had they crossed the frontier when John&rsquo;s troops
poured into the country, beat back the mercenaries
of Philip Augustus, and placed his banner
above the gates of the city. The people mournfully
submitted to his yoke, hoping in their secret
hearts for the return of their legitimate ruler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">With King Philip Augustus</span></h2>
<p>Constance and Arthur were received
at the court of Philip Augustus in Paris
not after the manner of fugitives. The
King gave them royal recognition, and
his spouse, the gracious Agnes of Meran, greeted
them most cordially. Philip evinced a peculiarly
friendly interest in Arthur; but he met his urgent
request for assistance with a quiet smile, saying, &ldquo;I
shall do all in my power to help you to retain your
possessions and all your rights. In the meantime,
as there is a quarrel to be settled between me and
the Count of Flanders, will you go with me and
win your spurs on my side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King looked sharply at Arthur, who, thirsting
for action, acceded to his proposal notwithstanding
the Duchess&rsquo;s disapproval. She was obliged to
consent in the end, however, for H&ouml;el and Alan,
who found idle court life intolerable, gladly agreed
to go also, and were eager to participate in the affair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Arthur was to be admitted to knighthood at once,
and chose Alan for his brother-in-arms. During
the night which preceded the important ceremony,
the youths kept knightly vigil to uplift their souls
in prayer. They were escorted by H&ouml;el and some
of the leading knights to the castle chapel, where
they were left alone, after an impressive parting.
The barred doors shut them out from the world,
and they knelt a long time before the altar, engaged
in their devotions. These concluded, they arose,
and with drawn swords made a circuit of the chapel
walls, pausing at times before the memorials of distinguished
princes, whose statues seemed almost
ghostly in the uncertain flickerings of the ever-burning
lamps. The banners fastened to the columns,
which reached to the dome, fluttered, and the
trophies gave out a hollow sound as the youths
passed them. At last they reached the altar again,
and almost involuntarily Arthur began to express
his deep emotions. He thought of the cruel fate
which had snatched his father from him, and of the
sorrowful burden which had overwhelmed his mother.
With a firm voice he pictured the future for which
he longed so ardently and hopefully. He would
earn distinction and fame under Philip&rsquo;s leadership,
and all brave heroes would gladly help him in his
struggle for his rights. Then, when Richard had returned
to the throne of England, and he had earned
Philip&rsquo;s good-will, how successfully his life would
unfold! &ldquo;And you, Alan, my brother-in-arms,&rdquo; he
said, turning to him, &ldquo;shall always be nearest my
side, however high a station I may reach.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Glowing with youthful enthusiasm, Alan knelt
before Arthur and lowered his sword with the utmost
reverence, for he believed in Arthur with all
his soul. Joyfully the latter exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, that
a sign might be given to reveal my future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the moon broke through the
clouds and illuminated the lofty stained glass windows.
In the sudden crimson glow Arthur and
Alan looked as if they were sprinkled with blood.
Their faces, hair, and shoulders were tinted a deep
red. They gazed upon one another with astonishment,
but the red glow soon disappeared, and they
were once more in the semi-darkness. Though the
effect, which was caused by the light passing through
the ruby-red panes, was easily explainable, yet they
were deeply impressed by it. They spoke no
more, but stood motionless by the altar, awaiting
the coming of day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The morning light had hardly broken when the
doors of the chapel were opened and a band of
knights came to greet their new brothers. H&ouml;el
embraced them and smiled at Arthur&rsquo;s disturbed
countenance; but when he saw that Alan too was
pale and agitated, he became serious. There was
no time to question them, for a multitude quickly
poured into the chapel. The entire court was soon
assembled. The ecclesiastics gathered about the
altar, and at last the King entered with the Queen
and the Duchess Constance. At the close of the
religious service Philip entered the chancel and bade
Arthur kneel. Touching his shoulder with his
sword, he dubbed him knight and received his vows.
When Alan had likewise been admitted to knighthood,
their golden spurs were given them, and
shouting &ldquo;Saint Denis!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Saint George!&rdquo; the
knights embraced their new comrades. All present
joined in congratulation, and H&ouml;el had to tear them
away almost by force, so that they might have rest
and refreshment and be in readiness for the afternoon&rsquo;s
tournament. When the time came, they
were assisted in putting on their armor by knights,
but Arthur kept his sash in his hand so that his
mother might bind it about him. The gloomy
night was forgotten, and as he passed along the spacious
corridors of the Louvre<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> every one he met
stopped to admire his youthful beauty and to make
smiling return for his friendly greeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>As he approached the Duchess&rsquo;s apartment he
heard delightful strains of music, and hesitated
about entering; for Constance, since the great sorrow
had come into her life, seldom touched the
harp. At last, however, he softly opened the door
and glanced into the large room. The Duchess
was reclining upon a couch, her head resting upon
her hand, and her pale face bedewed with tears.
A young lady, who was playing the harp, sat near
her on a tabouret. She ceased as Arthur quickly
advanced and bowed low to the two ladies. The
younger rose in surprise and looked inquiringly at
the Duchess, who took her hand and, turning to
Arthur, said, &ldquo;You must know, my son, who has
played so beautifully for my consolation. This is
the Princess Marie of France,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> whom Philip has
brought from the cloisters to-day. Though it is
our first meeting, she well knows my sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Noble lady,&rdquo; said Marie gently, &ldquo;I too have
known sorrow. My mother is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the blessing of Heaven comfort you,
gracious lady, and bring its peace to a heart which
knows so well how to comfort others,&rdquo; exclaimed
Arthur. &ldquo;I shall go to the field contentedly, for I
know that an angel will be at my mother&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trumpet peals from the courtyard summoned to
the tournament. The clank of armor was heard
in the anteroom, and knights were in waiting to act
as Arthur&rsquo;s escort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my first venture with arms, dear mother.
Give me your blessing, I beseech you,&rdquo; implored
Arthur; &ldquo;and you, Princess, shall tie on my sash as
a surety of good fortune in the contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie directed a questioning glance at the Duchess,
and when she smiled in return, threw the scarf
over Arthur&rsquo;s shoulder and fastened it. After a
word of thanks, Arthur hastened to his waiting
associates, and the ladies betook themselves to
the Queen, whose guests they were to be at the
tournament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The field was encircled with a dense throng of
persons of all ranks. The spectators watched
Arthur eagerly as he rode in, followed by Alan and
four knights, who drew up in line. Their adversaries
confronted them in similar line. At a signal
from the King the knights rushed at each other.
H&ouml;el smilingly watched his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>, who distinguished
themselves by their daring and dexterity.
At the first onset Arthur parried the thrust of his
enemy, and at the second advanced from the other
side with such fury that his opponent was taken off
his guard and was dismounted. Arthur was declared
victor. The same good fortune attended
him in the remaining contests, and at the close he
received a wreath from the Queen&rsquo;s own hands as
his prize. Never was handsomer knight seen than
Arthur, as with visor raised he lifted his crowned
head and saluted the princesses. At the court banquet
he was assigned a place between his mother
and the Princess Marie, and his heart swelled with
joy and pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The time for the departure of the expedition
drew nigh, and Arthur spent his leisure moments
in the company of the Duchess and her young
friend. On the last evening the King visited them,
and after a brief conversation turned to the Duke.
&ldquo;Take a long farewell,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Guard yourself
in battle, for your reward will be Marie&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur and the Princess stood speechless with
surprise for some time, but the silence was at last
broken by the Duchess: &ldquo;Yes, Arthur, it is the
King&rsquo;s will to give Marie to you as wife, and to me
as daughter, some day, when our lot is a happier
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that I hope, with God&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; answered
the King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In the Field</span></h2>
<p>Arthur was in the field several months
with Philip, and though he had to endure
all that powerful warrior&rsquo;s severe discipline,
he fought for him as valiantly as
he would have done for himself. All this time the
enemy remained unsubdued; but at last the King,
having cut off all probable chance of escape, looked
for a decisive result. The day for the attack was
fixed, and everything was made ready. On the
evening before the battle, after issuing his orders,
the King retired to his tent to read some letters
which a messenger had brought from Paris. The
chancellor urgently entreated him to return, for disorder
was spreading, and the finances were in such
desperate condition that he could procure no more
money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the King to himself, &ldquo;how shall we
meet the needs of the Empire? There is but one
way. The Jews must empty their pockets. The
ban shall be raised. We expelled them to please
the Pope, who is now secretly plotting with my enemies
against me and annoying me in every way.&rdquo;
The King called for his secretary, but instead of
that official a knight suddenly entered the tent.
Recognizing Arthur, he waited for him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my King,&rdquo; said Arthur excitedly, &ldquo;I have
had news from my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip frowned and asked, &ldquo;What does John
want now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My news is not from John; I am speaking of
Richard. He is free. He is no longer a prisoner
in the castle of Trifels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; interrupted the King, &ldquo;has the ransom
been furnished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is free,&rdquo; repeated Arthur; &ldquo;a deserter from
the Netherlands brought the tidings. Richard has
embarked on the Holland coast. They recognized
him, though he went there in disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone!&rdquo; said the astonished King. &ldquo;Oh, the
Lion-hearted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt he has crossed to England,&rdquo;
continued Arthur excitedly, &ldquo;and now it is time
my King, for me to hasten to his assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thoughtless youth!&rdquo; broke in Philip, &ldquo;would
you forsake me before the end of the campaign and
ingloriously leave before we know whether Richard
has actually reached his fatherland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur grew thoughtful, and retired to consult
H&ouml;el and Alan. The latter was eager to go, for
he was not enthusiastic in his devotion to Philip;
he would rather have fought for Richard. But
H&ouml;el twirled his gray mustache and shook his
head. He feared Richard&rsquo;s rash and unstable disposition,
and knew that he could not be relied upon.
&ldquo;Philip is right in this matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let us
first dispose of this Fleming; after that it will be
time to think of the other matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle was fought the next day, and resulted
in the defeat of the Count of Flanders after a stout
resistance. The King himself led his warriors, sword
in hand, in an attack upon the enemy, who were
seeking to hold a bridge. His battle-cry, &ldquo;Montjoie
St. Denis!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> spread panic in the ranks of his foes,
and &ldquo;Plantagenet!&rdquo; &ldquo;Plantagenet!&rdquo; resounded
where Arthur and his knights were fighting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The victory was won. The enemy were driven
over the bridge, and threw away their arms. The
King warmly congratulated Arthur upon his bravery,
but did not grant his request for leave of absence.
Arthur reluctantly submitted rather than make his
appearance before Richard as a fugitive without
knights or warriors.</p>
<p>In the meantime Richard reached England; and
as soon as he had announced his presence to his
friends he ascended the throne amid popular rejoicings,
John yielding his claim with seeming
willingness. About the same time Philip returned
to Paris; Arthur accompanied him, and was so delighted
to see his mother and bride once more that
he forgot his longing to go to Richard.</p>
<p>Banquets and tournaments were arranged by the
court, and Arthur, because of his bravery, was the
central figure among all the youthful heroes. So
continuous were the feasts and sports that he hardly
had time for thought.</p>
<p>One morning Alan, equipped and spurred as for
a long ride, came to Arthur&rsquo;s bedside and woke
him, saying, &ldquo;Richard is in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hasten to him, then,&rdquo; said Arthur,
springing up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;You had better not go. It will only occasion
needless delay. Let me go to your uncle,&rdquo; implored
Alan. &ldquo;I can reach him quickly. He is about to
attack the Duke of Limoges, and is camped with
his little army before the fortress of Chalus. I will
tell him all, and if he calls you, you need no longer
hesitate. Let me go, my Prince, and keep my mission
a secret from the court. They are playing false
with you, one and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alan rushed out, and Arthur looked after him in
surprise. Only H&ouml;el knew of his son&rsquo;s undertaking,
and he gave out that he had sent him away.
Philip, who was well apprised of what was going
on, kept quiet, and only sought to attach Arthur
to him still more closely.</p>
<p>When the entertainment came to an end, Philip
left the Louvre to hold court at Compi&egrave;gne<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> during
the beautiful springtime. How delightful it was to
roam about that great forest! Every day the Princess
rode on her white palfrey, with her falcon
attached to her slender wrist, Duke Arthur riding
by her side upon his fiery Arab steed, which had
been given him by the King. A band of companions
and servants on foot and on horse followed
them, and the hills and woods resounded with the
baying of hounds and the halloos of hunters. A
mystic charm seemed to pervade the greenwood,
which protected them from all contact with the
outside world and made life a happy dream. The
Duchess herself seemed to forget her grief and the
insecurity of her affairs, and the King encouraged
all these joyous sports without participating in
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>But suddenly these happy revellers were recalled
to the realities of life by a fearful occurrence. King
Richard the Lion-hearted was dead before Chalus&mdash;killed
by an arrow. Arthur could not believe the
dreadful news until Alan, pale and exhausted by his
hard ride, arrived and confirmed it. He came from
the spot, was with the King when he received his
death wound, and brought his last message of continued
faith in Arthur&rsquo;s loyalty and uprightness,
and his wish that he could once more see his
nephew. But, alas, it was too late now! The
great Lion-hearted was gone, and John mounted
the vacant throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, so long as I live, will I relinquish my
paternal inheritance,&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">War Preparations</span></h2>
<p>In the excitement which King Richard&rsquo;s death
produced in England, Eleanor contrived to
secure an appearance of justice in John&rsquo;s sovereignty.
A spurious will of Henry the Second&rsquo;s
was opened by her, by the provisions of which
John was given the crown, regardless of the legitimate
claims of the son of Geoffrey, his oldest brother.
By this means Arthur was also cut off from the succession.
The injustice was clear enough; but John,
with the aid of a strong following of the nobles, whom
he had secured by artifice and promises, kept possession
of power. The time was now come for
Philip Augustus openly and without delay to maintain
Arthur&rsquo;s rights. Nothing less was at stake than
the title to the English crown. John was declared
a throne-robber, and was summoned as a feudal
tenant before the French tribunal. In case of disobedience
war would be declared against him. John
had already made his plans to go to France at the
head of an army, with the intention, as far as he
was able, of permanently wresting the English provinces
from the domination of France. He had not
a doubt he could easily settle the claims of Constance
and Arthur and succeed in his purpose. Determined
as Philip Augustus may have been to defend
Arthur&rsquo;s rights, somehow the war preparations were
delayed much longer than seemed safe to the Duke,
who could scarcely conceal his impatience. He resolved
to challenge his uncle to single combat, and
reluctantly followed the advice of his mother to act
with caution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why does Philip hesitate?&rdquo; he indignantly
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the King is waiting for money,&rdquo; replied
H&ouml;el.</p>
<p>Arthur contemptuously shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; sighed Constance, &ldquo;how can our plans
succeed? We are very poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur hastened to the Louvre, and although the
chamberlain informed him that the King was holding
an important interview, he insisted upon admission.
Nothing could be more urgent than his own affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves you right,&rdquo; the King was saying as
the Duke was announced. Philip was seated at a
table covered with papers. By his side stood an old
man in a cringing attitude, who cast a hasty glance
at Arthur as he entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, cousin,&rdquo; said the King, with a smile.
&ldquo;You have come in time to be a partner in our
business arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beckoned to the old man, who submissively
bowed his head. His spare figure was clad in a
dark cloak of heavy silk. A tall black velvet cap
covered his head and his long gray locks hung down
his shoulders. His attire proclaimed him a Jew,
and when he began to speak his voice awakened
memories in Arthur&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;spare us this
demand. Our coffers are still empty because of
the treasures you took from us not long ago, when
Your Grace allowed us to return to your kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall only lend to us this time,&rdquo; said the
King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what security?&rdquo; quickly asked the Jew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon this security,&rdquo; said Arthur, turning toward
him and displaying the ring he wore on his finger.
&ldquo;Would you like to see the note also?&rdquo; he said
with a smile. &ldquo;Do you know how it reads?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The Jew hesitated an instant, then turned the
ring to the light and looked keenly at Arthur.
Raising his head, he said with a certain nobility
of expression, &ldquo;I know you. You are the Duke of
Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say rather, the King of England,&rdquo; added Philip.
&ldquo;Well, Arthur, let us close up this business with
Abraham, which has already fruitlessly consumed
an hour of our time. Listen, Abraham. We need
thirty thousand gold gulden to equip our troops,
and a like sum in six months to pay them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King arose, and Abraham went to the door;
but before leaving he turned to Arthur and said in
a low tone, &ldquo;If you will come to my poor abode
this evening, most gracious Duke, you shall be
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In the House of the Jew</span></h2>
<p>At nightfall Arthur and Alan, stoutly armed,
proceeded to the Jewish Quarter, which
occupied a remote part of the city and
was surrounded by walls. Its only gate
was open, and the two passed undisturbed through
the dark narrow streets, bordered with tall houses.
The few windows were barred with iron shutters, and
wherever a door was open one might fancy he was
looking into an endless vault. Human figures appeared
now and then, timorously avoiding the gaze
of the strangers, and looking after them suspiciously
from their lurking places. It was with some difficulty
that Alan induced an old woman to stop and
tell them where Abraham lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Abraham&rsquo;s house was a large one, with tightly
closed doors and windows. At the sound of the
knocker, a wicket was opened behind the iron grating
and a voice asked the strangers&rsquo; business. Alan
answered cautiously that they were expected by
Abraham. Thereupon followed a clanking of bars
and bolts; the heavy door was opened, and Abraham
stood on the threshold, bowing low, and saying:
&ldquo;Welcome, noble gentlemen! Enter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not without some apprehension that the
youths followed him through a low, dimly lighted
passageway. The air was close and heavy, and no
sound could be heard from without. At last their
guide opened a door, threw back a dark curtain, and
bowed the strangers into an apartment where they
stood as transfixed with surprise as if they had
entered another world. They knew not whether
they were in a garden or a salon. High walls with
many columns, balconies, and galleries enclosed a
spacious room which, open above, disclosed the sky.
A splashing fountain occupied the centre. All about
flamed countless tapers upon metal candelabra set in
luxurious flower-beds. Groups of shrubs bearing
rare fruit sprang from the soil, which was covered
with fine green turf and colored stones set in a beautiful
mosaic. Here and there were heavy purple
rugs upon which soft, gold-tasselled cushions were
scattered about. Festoons of flowers and rich draperies
depended from the galleries and columns. A
banquet table set with glistening crystal and silver
plate stood upon an estrade. The youths seated
themselves upon a silk-covered settle with golden
feet, and Abraham said with the utmost reverence:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be my guests, noble gentlemen, and count it no
disgrace to eat with a Jew, whom you, my gracious
Duke, once rescued when he was near to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham clapped his hands and two handsome,
black-eyed boys came forward, bringing the strangers
perfumed water in silver bowls. Then food and
sweet, spicy wines were set before them. But all
this was done without noise and with soft, quick
movements; for at meals the Jews were always
apprehensive and ever in readiness for flight.
Abraham was the first to speak. Turning to the
Duke, he said: &ldquo;The gold which King Philip demanded
I refused, for he has already had enough
from us. Are you sure indeed that if he had
it, he would use it for your advantage, Duke of
Brittany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur replied that it was only the lack of money
which kept him from beginning the war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you expect to gain the crown of England?
Would you not be fortunate even if Brittany
were your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur reddened and said, somewhat hesitatingly,
&ldquo;It is my right, my inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; continued Abraham. &ldquo;You would
grace a throne, and what I can do shall be at your
service. King Philip may have the gold, and I hope
it will be used for your advantage. But a younger
prince needs many things which he may not obtain
from the King. Perhaps I may in some ways realize
your wishes also. Be pleased, gracious Duke,
to follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abraham led the astonished youths into a subterranean
vault lit by a lamp from above, unlocked
a massive chest, and, lifting the heavy lid, invited
Arthur to come nearer. It was filled with golden
ornaments and jewels. Opening a second chest,
which was filled with leathern bags, he said: &ldquo;Accept.
Every bag contains a thousand gold pieces.
Accept, noble Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Arthur, stepping back. &ldquo;What
you give Philip will suffice me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Philip will have to give me security,&rdquo; said
Abraham; &ldquo;that is our business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can give you no security,&rdquo; replied
Arthur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;You yourself are my security, Duke,&rdquo; said
Abraham with great earnestness. &ldquo;When you shall
come to the throne you will not forget the children
of Israel, and you will allow them a home in your
dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise that,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Once I have
the power, I will be a just ruler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this as a souvenir of this hour,&rdquo; said the
Jew, throwing a golden chain around Arthur&rsquo;s neck.
Then he turned to Alan and gave him a bag of
gold. &ldquo;Equip a special troop of trusty, valiant
men who will stand by your Duke in every time of
danger,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I do not mean men like you,
for such hearts as yours cannot be bought with
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said Alan as Abraham placed
one bag after another in Alan&rsquo;s cloak. &ldquo;Thanks!
thanks, Abraham! Farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God prosper you,&rdquo; said Abraham as he escorted
them to the street. They had some difficulty in
getting out of the Quarter, as the gate was closed,
but when Alan announced their names to the captain
of the watch, it was opened at once. They
hurried back to their dwelling and told their experiences
to H&ouml;el, who advised them to let no one but
Constance know how they came by their treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Arthur&rsquo;s Departure</span></h2>
<p>The recruiting of troops for the Duke
of Brittany now made rapid progress.
Famous knights offered themselves and
their followers for his service. Many of
the leaders in the Crusade, who had been forced
to discharge their followers, now assembled them
anew under H&ouml;el&rsquo;s standard and accepted his
earnest money, and Alan selected sixteen knights,
the flower of the young nobles, who devoted
themselves to the exclusive personal service of
the Duke and received a princely sum for their
outfit.</p>
<p>The court ladies also took an active part in the
war preparations and assembled daily in the Queen&rsquo;s
apartments to work upon fine embroideries. Arthur
and his knights were provided with gorgeous banners
and sashes, and were often consulted about
their decoration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Marie,&rdquo; said Arthur, noticing her work,
&ldquo;place no king&rsquo;s crown above my escutcheon; as
a true Plantagenet, the broom flower is my only
emblem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, not John, are the King,&rdquo; replied
Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will decide that on the field,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>All his petty troubles vanished, Philip was now
ready for the successful prosecution of his plans.
He decided that Arthur should go with a part of the
force to Anjou and establish himself there, and he
himself would follow later with the main army and
completely shatter John&rsquo;s power. But before he
made any move, Philip resolved to attach Arthur
yet more closely to him by marrying him to the
Princess Marie. The bridal pair, as well as the
Duchess, were greatly surprised by this decision,
and only the nearest intimates were bidden secretly
to the nuptial ceremony. At midnight, in the
glare of torches, Arthur stood with his bride before
the altar, where he had lately been admitted to
knighthood. Alan thought of that night, and
glanced at the window through which the red
light had streamed upon them. But no evil omen
disturbed the blessing which the priest invoked
upon the union. The marriage was celebrated
next day at court, and at the same time the coming
departure of the Duke was announced. At last
the moment was at hand when Arthur must leave
all and take the field to fight for the crown of his
ancestors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Duchess Constance strove hard to remain calm
as she bade Arthur farewell, but her heart sank
within her as she thought of the dangers he must
encounter. Gladly would she have restrained him
from the undertaking into which he had impetuously
thrown himself. Holding him in sorrowful
embrace, she said with quivering voice: &ldquo;Farewell,
my son! My only one! May the saints preserve
you.&rdquo; The Princess Marie also embraced him,
sobbing: &ldquo;Do not go, my husband! I shall never
see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep good courage, Marie. God is merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But men are cruel. Oh, stay with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me fight for my honor and my crown.
You shall see me return victorious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Arthur tore himself away and left them. A
band of his knights awaited him in the castle yard
and Alan was holding his steed&rsquo;s bridle. Arthur
swung himself into the saddle and, with a glance
and a wave of his hand toward the balcony where
Constance and Marie were standing, rode to the
head of his followers. With an exultant shout,
&ldquo;France for Plantagenet!&rdquo; and with banners
waving and arms glistening, the Duke of Brittany
led the way to fight afar for his crown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The War with John</span></h2>
<p>Arthur advanced unmolested with his little
force on the road to Anjou, via Touraine,
until he reached Tours. He expected to
encounter the first resistance there; and
indeed a considerable armed band did meet him
near the city gate, but not with hostile design.
They were knights of Anjou and Poitou, who had
deserted King John and come out of the city to
welcome Arthur. As soon as the Duke came in
sight they loudly shouted, &ldquo;Hail, all hail, Arthur
Plantagenet, King of England!&rdquo; Both surprised
and delighted, Arthur entered the hospitable city.
The people welcomed him in the most friendly
manner and escorted him to the bishop&rsquo;s palace,
where quarters had been provided for him and his
leaders. A grand banquet, given by the burghers
in his honor, closed the day&rsquo;s festivities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The next morning H&ouml;el advised the Prince not
to indulge too long in entertainments, nor revel
in fancied security, but to hold a serious council of
war at once. Arthur thereupon summoned his leading
knights to the great hall of the palace, where he
also appeared, accompanied by the bishop. As he
ascended the steps to the throne seat and took his
place, he was truly regal in person and bearing.
Though he wore a simple duke&rsquo;s cap, he bore himself
with as much dignity as if it were a kingly crown.
Looking around upon the assembly with an air of
ease and self-possession, he said: &ldquo;Noble knights
and gentlemen, thanks for your readiness and goodwill
in coming to my assistance against John, my
usurping uncle. I ask for your advice as to the
most effective method of attacking him. One hundred
knights and their followers are here, and in a
few days a like number will be sent us from our
loyal Brittany. But, hardly three days&rsquo; journey
from here, John has thrice that number of experienced
troops. It would be useless to cope with
such a powerful force before King Philip&rsquo;s troops
join us. That will be soon. If you agree with me,
we will await the King&rsquo;s arrival here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Arthur ceased, and the knights began making
suggestions. H&ouml;el, the most experienced of them
all, supported his proposal, but the knights of
Anjou and Poitou were not in favor of delay. In
the midst of the general indecision, one of the foremost
of them, the Count of Aubigny, advanced and
said: &ldquo;Duke, permit me to state my plan. Instead
of idly awaiting King Philip here, let us make an
advance movement. Not far from here is the small
fortress of Mirabeau, where Queen Eleanor and her
garrison are shut in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo; muttered Arthur, with lowering brows
and blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city is poorly defended,&rdquo; continued the
Count, &ldquo;though it has for its champion William
Longsword, Earl of Salisbury. But we have captured
two letters from the Queen to John, in which
she urgently implores him to come to her relief,
as they cannot hold the city in case of attack. What
is your decision, noble gentlemen? Shall we march
to Mirabeau, surprise the fortress, and take the
Queen prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hazardous proposition met with the approval
of the majority, notwithstanding H&ouml;el&rsquo;s protests
and Arthur&rsquo;s advice to wait a day or two for
news from King Philip. They were outvoted, and
at last reluctantly consented rather than subject
themselves to the reproach of cowardice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>A few days later, Arthur and his small force
reached the walls of Mirabeau. H&ouml;el was assigned
to the leadership of the assault, and strove to conduct
the undertaking, which he could not prevent,
as judiciously as possible. The city gates were
forced open, and after a short struggle the assailants
advanced into the city. But a more difficult task
awaited them&mdash;the capture of the citadel in which
Queen Eleanor and her defenders were sheltered.
H&ouml;el vainly sought to mass his force and storm
the fortress. While Arthur and Alan advanced
with their close-set column of knights, the others
were straggling about the city in quest of plunder.
As H&ouml;el with his trusty band approached the citadel
tower, he was struck by a missile hurled from
the roof. H&ouml;el fell, and the rest stood as if rooted
to the spot. The English took advantage of the
occurrence to make a sally from the tower and threw
the ranks of the knights into dire confusion. Instead
of regular battle a fearful hand-to-hand encounter
ensued; but Arthur had time enough when H&ouml;el
fell to order the nearest knights to dismount and remove
him from the scene of the fighting. He then
turned and commanded Alan to follow his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never more,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;I must follow you
as honor demands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>There was no longer time for words. The advanced
rank of the English was already upon them,
and the young heroes stood with drawn swords
ready to meet the onset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound an alarm!&rdquo; shouted Arthur to the trumpeters,
hoping thereby to summon the absent knights
to their assistance. The call was in vain. Not a
friend appeared. But hark! In the distance another
trumpet blast answered his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur. But Alan
was as ignorant of its meaning as himself. Suddenly
a knight rode forward from the English side&mdash;a
stalwart figure on a black steed, motioned his followers
to halt, and pointing with his sword to Arthur,
said: &ldquo;Surrender, Duke of Brittany. Resistance
is useless. The trumpet you have heard announces
the approach of King John&rsquo;s army. Your confederates
are defeated. You are surrounded, and retreat
is cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will fight for life and liberty like a true
knight,&rdquo; replied Arthur. &ldquo;I will never surrender
myself to John.&rdquo; He rushed upon the knight, and
Alan attacked another. Superior in skill and self-confidence,
Arthur&rsquo;s adversary acted upon the
defensive until the Duke&rsquo;s sword point touched
his breastplate. Upon this the English knight no
longer restrained himself, but returned blow for blow
and thrust for thrust. During the encounter Arthur&rsquo;s
horse stumbled and fell, carrying his rider with him.
He was on his feet in an instant, but the fastenings
of his helmet were broken in the fall and the Duke&rsquo;s
head was unprotected. The English knight did not
take advantage of this, but lowered his sword and
said: &ldquo;You have fought bravely and can do no
more, Duke of Brittany. Surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; said Arthur, also lowering his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Arthur bitterly, &ldquo;a Plantagenet!
How could you have the heart, cousin, to fight against
Henry&rsquo;s nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended his sword. Salisbury took it, and,
gazing at Arthur, said in a tone of utter astonishment:
&ldquo;By Heaven, his features prove the truth
of his words. Geoffrey, as he was in life!&rdquo; Then
advancing, he said, &ldquo;My prince and cousin, most
unwillingly I take you prisoner, but you shall be a
prisoner only in name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you satisfactorily explain this to
John?&rdquo; asked Arthur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged. You may think evil
of him, and unfortunately I cannot altogether defend
his course, but he will not tarnish his knightly honor
by abuse of a prisoner. Follow me, Duke Arthur,
and rest assured I shall treat you with the utmost
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fighting paused while the two were conversing,
and at last Salisbury gave the order for cessation
of battle. But where were those young knights who
had followed Arthur? Scattered, wounded, or captured,
they were forced to declare themselves defeated,
like their Duke.</p>
<p>Turning to Arthur, Salisbury asked, &ldquo;What are
your wishes with regard to your followers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, noble Salisbury, you will arrange matters
so that at the close of the war they may be
ransomed and return to their homes. Above all,
care for the Knight Mordant. He fell at the very
outset&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; interposed Salisbury, with the utmost
emotion. &ldquo;My old companion in arms fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is his son,&rdquo; said Arthur, taking Alan
by the hand. &ldquo;Permit him to attend his father or
bury his body.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Without hesitation Salisbury replied: &ldquo;He shall
go free, and keep his steed and weapons, if he will
give his promise not to fight against England for
a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stir among those standing near them diverted
the attention of the speakers. Six soldiers came in
sight bearing the body of Knight H&ouml;el Mordant
prone upon their lances. With a despairing cry
Alan bent over the body, the warriors also showing
signs of sorrow at the loss of the hero. At last
Alan rose and said with trembling voice: &ldquo;I no
longer desire my liberty. Let me remain with my
Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Arthur answered: &ldquo;For my sake, Alan,
accept the Earl&rsquo;s offer. Hasten to my wife and
mother and urge my friends to send a ransom to
John, that I may be released. Take this ring. You
know who gave it to me. He has the power to help
me.&rdquo; Arthur took Abraham&rsquo;s ring from his finger
and placed it upon Alan&rsquo;s. When Alan would have
offered objection, Arthur said for the first time in a
tone of command, &ldquo;I wish it.&rdquo; As his loyal friend
sorrowfully bowed in submission, Arthur stretched
out his arms and embraced him. They remained
thus until Alan looked upon Arthur with sad eyes
and tore himself away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>At Salisbury&rsquo;s signal his men escorted him and
the Duke to the gate of the tower, in front of which
guards were stationed with crossed halberds. As
they approached, the guards lowered their weapons
and admitted them. Out of the brilliant glow of
the evening sky Arthur entered the gloom of the
vaulted passage. Salisbury quickly followed him,
and the Duke of Brittany was a prisoner.</p>
<p>Alan remained immovable upon his steed as long
as he could see a trace of Arthur&rsquo;s retreating figure,
but when it disappeared behind the dark walls, he
gave spurs to his horse and galloped at full speed
through the city and out into the country toward
Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Imprisonment</span></h2>
<p>Several days had passed since Arthur
entered the tower of Mirabeau, where by
Salisbury&rsquo;s orders a large and well-furnished
room was provided for him. He not only
had all the necessities for comfort, but much personal
pleasure, for famous English visitors to Mirabeau
were permitted to call upon him. Whenever
he appeared upon the walls in the company of an
attendant, the soldiers of the garrison hastened to
see him. He greeted them in such a cordial yet
dignified manner that many a hearty benediction
was uttered by them.</p>
<p>Salisbury himself visited him almost daily, and
manifested the utmost concern for the welfare of his
famous cousin. Upon such occasions Arthur frequently
spoke of England and indulged in fancies
of what he would do if he were King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; said Salisbury, with a smile. &ldquo;I must
not listen. You are talking high treason.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>At the very outset of his imprisonment Arthur
had longed for an interview with his grandmother,
Queen Eleanor. She declined seeing him, however,
until she had ascertained John&rsquo;s intentions. But
just at this time she had a letter from her son, in
which he wrote: &ldquo;I shall be with you in a few
days. Having performed all your duties to the
Prince hitherto, see to it in some way that he is
harmless in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen clearly understood the double meaning
of his words and considered the best means
for carrying out his wishes. One day she abruptly
said to Salisbury, &ldquo;Bring your prisoner to me in
the morning.&rdquo; As he hesitated about replying, she
added in the most insolent manner, &ldquo;I hear continually
about your intercourse with the Duke, and
it does not please me, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my long sword,&rdquo; replied Salisbury impetuously,
&ldquo;I would rather be the object of your suspicion
than have you cause the Prince to suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he really as captivating as that?&rdquo; said
Eleanor, changing her tone. &ldquo;I notice the people
take no pains to conceal their admiration of his
fine face and knightly bearing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is&mdash;and you may as well know it,&rdquo; replied
Salisbury&mdash;&ldquo;he is a Plantagenet from head to foot;
and those who doubt it, or seek to make others
doubt it, have malicious designs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we have recognized him as a Plantagenet
and our grandson, it will be time to award him his
proper rank. We will see him in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salisbury looked sharply at the Queen, as if to
discover her purpose, but one of his honest, straightforward
nature could not read this crafty woman.
He determined, however, to watch over Arthur with
increased vigilance, for&mdash;and the reason he could
hardly explain himself&mdash;the youth had won his
love and devotion.</p>
<p>While Arthur was attending mass the next
morning with Salisbury, the Queen was arranging
for the interview with the son of the hated Constance
in her apartment. Two soldiers of the royal
bodyguard submissively received her orders. As
she sat at a table covered with papers and writing
materials she heard the gong strike the hour
which marked the close of the morning service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Step behind those doors,&rdquo; she said to the
soldiers, &ldquo;and await this signal. As soon as you
hear me strike that metal cup with this silver key,
enter, overpower and bind the prisoner, then do
what I shall order. But hold! Before you go,
make a hotter fire in that brazier so that the irons
may be heated&mdash;now, go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard disappeared behind the door, and
Eleanor, gazing fixedly at the irons in the coals,
said to herself: &ldquo;&lsquo;Let him be made harmless in the
future,&rsquo; John says; well, a blind man is harmless
enough. He will not fascinate people when he has
lost his sight. A blind king never can rule over
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steps were heard in the passage leading to the
apartment, and as the Queen turned her head, she
saw Arthur and Salisbury entering. Arthur stopped
a moment, awaiting a greeting from the Queen,
who sat in silence. As he approached her and she
observed his noble figure and beautiful face, she
suddenly rose and put out her hands as if to keep
him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you send me away? Will you not speak
to your grandson?&rdquo; said Arthur reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandson!&rdquo; said Eleanor, with her eyes
bent upon him. &ldquo;No&mdash;my son&mdash;Geoffrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Salisbury, &ldquo;one might fancy Geoffrey
had come back to life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that it were so, if it would only give me
his mother&rsquo;s love!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur, kneeling
and taking the Queen&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not recall him,&rdquo; replied Eleanor passionately.
&ldquo;Geoffrey scorned his mother&rsquo;s love. I
loved him better than any of my sons, and he
gave his heart to Constance of Brittany, whom I
detest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak of my mother,&rdquo; quickly replied
Arthur. &ldquo;Oh, she is good and noble. What has
she done that you should hate her so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo; replied Eleanor. &ldquo;She
alienated my son from me. He no longer loved
me. He no longer listened to my advice. He
was disloyal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was your advice always sound?&rdquo; asked Salisbury,
with great earnestness. &ldquo;Be fair, Queen.
Remember, it was your advice that led Geoffrey
into rebellion against his king and father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of that, Salisbury,&rdquo; interposed
Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; resumed Arthur. &ldquo;Let bygones be bygones.
Be reconciled to my mother. I will love you
both, if you will only permit it, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>There was deep emotion in his supplicating tone
and looks, and Eleanor was touched by it. She
stood for a moment reflecting; then, turning to
Salisbury, she said, &ldquo;Leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salisbury withdrew slowly and reluctantly, but
ready to return at the first summons. Eleanor
looked earnestly at the Duke as she said: &ldquo;Listen,
Arthur. I am old, but I am still capable of love
and of hatred. I could love you, image of my
favorite son, and so exalt you that you would
never need again to wear Philip&rsquo;s armor. If I so
wish, John will choose you as his successor, and
will so engage upon his kingly honor. John must
obey my wishes and the consent of all England will
follow. I can give you the crown. I now proffer
it to you, but upon one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked Arthur with trembling voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must accompany me to England and cut
loose from all you leave in France. The Pope
will dissolve your union with the Princess Marie.
You must declare war against Philip Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must leave her to her fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Arthur. &ldquo;Oh, you are heartless,
grandmother. If I thought my heart was capable of
such wickedness, I would tear it out of my breast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once more I leave you free to make a
decision. Choose,&rdquo; said Eleanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will choose disgrace!&rdquo; exclaimed
Arthur.</p>
<p>Eleanor stepped to the table and took the silver
key from the metal cup. As she raised her hand
to strike, her gaze fell upon Arthur&rsquo;s eyes, which
were glistening as if he were inspired. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
muttered, &ldquo;I cannot do it. They are Geoffrey&rsquo;s
eyes.&rdquo; The key fell upon the soft carpet from her
helpless hand. &ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let us
never see each other again in this life.&rdquo; She placed
her hands upon Arthur&rsquo;s shoulders and looked at
him long and earnestly. Then she sadly withdrew
them and turned away. Arthur hurried from the
apartment and met Salisbury, who had been waiting
for him at the threshold. When Eleanor found
she was alone, she stamped her foot and summoned
the guards. &ldquo;Take that away,&rdquo; she said, pointing
to the brazier; &ldquo;the fire is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>During Arthur&rsquo;s visit to the Queen, reports of
the interview and of Eleanor&rsquo;s evil designs against
her grandson spread through the city. There
was great excitement, and open threats were made
against her. As Arthur mounted the stairs with
Salisbury he was greeted with loud applause by
soldiers and knights in the castle yard. &ldquo;Here
he is,&rdquo; shouted those nearest him. &ldquo;He lives,&rdquo;
said others, and suddenly all joined in the enthusiastic
cry, &ldquo;Long live Arthur Plantagenet!&rdquo; The
Duke, overcome with surprise, waved his hand and
thanked them. Then he followed Salisbury, who
made a passage for him through the crowd with
some difficulty. The shouts were audible in the
apartment of the Queen, where, concealed behind a
curtain, she was watching the throng below.</p>
<p>The dangerous excitement hastened her decision
to deliver Arthur to the King. She might possibly
have changed her intentions had not John entered
Mirabeau that same evening with his army. As
soon as he was alone with his mother, he inquired
about Arthur, and broke into a fury of passion
when he found that nothing had happened to the
prisoner. His rage increased when he learned of
the favorable impression his nephew had made
upon the English troops and that Eleanor herself
had shown a disposition to sympathize with him.
&ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I find you negotiating
with Arthur, especially when unexpected
events have thrown him into my power? Are you
helping him, mother? Go, go! You have grown
old and weak. I care nothing for his adherence to
my cause or for Philip&rsquo;s assistance. Possession and
right are on my side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;The right!&rdquo; replied Eleanor. &ldquo;Ask your
conscience in what manner King Henry&rsquo;s will gave
you that right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I know that I am
indebted to your cunning; but still you must
remain loyal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; replied Eleanor, &ldquo;but listen to
my advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough for the present,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;We will
think about the matter to-morrow morning, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur had passed the day alone, as neither
Salisbury nor any of the knights had been to see
him. About dark the watch, who came every
evening to see that all was well, entered his room.
Contrary to his usual custom he greeted Arthur
curtly and was about to retire. Thereupon Arthur
said to him, &ldquo;How is it, Captain Norbert, that
you have nothing to tell me to-day? You usually
bring me some news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News is not always good news, gracious
Prince,&rdquo; replied the captain significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean not good for me? What is it?
Explain,&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>The captain approached nearer and said in a
low voice, &ldquo;King John, your uncle, has arrived,&rdquo;
upon which he left so suddenly that Arthur could
not question him further.</p>
<p>The intelligence weighed heavily upon him. Up
to this time he had supposed that imprisonment,
longer or shorter, would be the worst that could
happen to him, but now he felt a misgiving that
John would make a final decision as to his fate,
and the hopelessness of the situation depressed his
usually cheerful nature. With ardent longing he
yearned to see his mother, Marie, and Alan; at
last, overcome with sorrow, he wept bitter tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">King John</span></h2>
<p>On the following day John summoned the
leading nobles and commanders who had
accompanied him to France to the great
hall of the old castle of Mirabeau. Besides
famous Salisbury, Lords Pembroke, Bigot, and
Essex were in attendance, as well as knights and
leading personages in great number. All awaited
the Duke of Brittany with eager interest. They
had heard so much about him since their arrival
that many of them were greatly surprised and had
besieged Salisbury with questions. Meanwhile
Salisbury himself had not ventured to see the Duke,
as the King had issued stringent orders that no
one should be admitted to him. Arthur now
realized that his fate was in John&rsquo;s hands, and he
was filled with fear and solicitude. He showed no
traces of it, however, when he appeared in the hall
attended by an armed escort. He was in his best
apparel, which had been kept for him by Salisbury.
Over a violet silk doublet he wore a short, gold-embroidered
mantle of white satin and a scarf with
the arms of the Plantagenets on it. Only the sword
was lacking to complete the attire of knighthood.
With a firm step and erect head he went directly in
front of the King&rsquo;s seat, bowed respectfully, lifting
his cap and replacing it immediately, as was the right
of one of equal birth. Then he looked about quietly
upon the assemblage. The impression which he
made is almost indescribable. Many remembered to
have seen him with King Richard in Rouen and recalled
the favor which his uncle had shown him.
Others, who had never seen him, recognized with
great emotion Duke Geoffrey&rsquo;s face and figure reflected
in his son. John also had observed the likeness,
and it greatly disquieted him. A rustle and
low murmurs were heard all over the hall until John
spoke, and then deep silence prevailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not our fault, my nephew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
I am receiving you here. It would not have been
so had you accepted my invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your invitation, uncle?&rdquo; replied Arthur, not
addressing him by his royal title. &ldquo;I know of no
invitation except the one to surrender which your
troops sent to our cities.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied John with a show of irritation,
&ldquo;your mother, instead of applying to her husband&rsquo;s
family for protection, besought it of Philip
Augustus, King of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why was Geoffrey&rsquo;s widow forced to seek
for outside help, except that her legitimate protectors
had become her enemies? No, my uncle, you
cannot justify what has happened, but you can make
reparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You well know my claims,&rdquo; replied Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I scorn them,&rdquo; said the King menacingly.
&ldquo;Bethink you. You are a prisoner. You should
be more moderate of speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imprisonment cannot make wrong right. It is
more likely to add new wrongs to old ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; thundered John. &ldquo;How does a mere
worm, whom I can trample under my feet, dare to
be so bold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s hand involuntarily sought his missing
sword. Blazing with anger, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Shame
upon you thus to abuse and threaten a prisoner!
Even if you despise the ties of relationship, at
least honor the obligations of knighthood, to which
we both belong.&rdquo; The knights present loudly
applauded these words, occasioning much confusion.
Thereupon John, chagrined as he realized he had
gone too far, quietly observed: &ldquo;I am the best
judge of what is becoming to knighthood. The
honor of the King stands higher still. You may
retire, Duke Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King beckoned to the guards and Arthur
was led away, taking with him the unmistakable
sympathy of all present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard, my lords, how this prisoner
defies me,&rdquo; resumed the King. A pause followed
these words, and lasted until Salisbury came forward
and said: &ldquo;The Duke spoke the truth; and as it
was youthful impulse which actuated him, I think,
and many others with me, that he had sufficient
excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lords Pembroke and Bigot, is that your
opinion?&rdquo; said the King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Venerable Lord Pembroke calmly replied: &ldquo;If the
grade of kinship alone entitled him to the succession,
Arthur would have the legitimate claim from
his father, Geoffrey, your eldest brother. Nay,
King, do not interrupt. Hear me out. We, the
lords of England, recognized you as King after
Richard&rsquo;s death, though well aware that a nearer
heir was living. But when we elevated you to the
throne we took into consideration not alone the
question of inheritance, but the welfare of England.
The fearful struggle after the first Henry&rsquo;s death,
in which rivers of blood were shed, to decide who
should wear the crown, is still fresh in the minds
of the people. Civil war must not again devastate
the country; and yet I most earnestly warn you
to treat your nephew, Arthur of Brittany, with
the consideration due to his rank, to honor him
in knightly fashion, and to give him back his
dukedom unimpaired. Promise me this, O King,
and receive anew our loyal devotion. Do you
endorse my proposal, noble lords?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The convincing importance of his statement, as
well as the imposing presence of Lord Pembroke,
made a profound impression, and all raised their
hands in assent.</p>
<p>John looked around the circle in a triumphant
manner and said in a conciliatory tone: &ldquo;I give the
promise which you desire unconditionally, my loving
and trusty followers. I am pained that you should
have believed I would not deal with my nephew as
becomes his rank, even without a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>All were, or at least seemed to be, satisfied with
the King&rsquo;s statement. Salisbury, however, still was
suspicious of John&rsquo;s sincerity. He asked permission
to visit the prisoner again. The King smilingly
granted it, saying: &ldquo;Go to him to-day, noble Earl,
for you must leave with a detachment of troops in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salisbury made no objection to this, for he did
not know that not only he, but all the nobles who
had shown favor toward Arthur, would be sent
away, and that the Duke would be left behind in
the King&rsquo;s power. He was detained so long by the
King upon business matters and friendly pretences
that little time was left for him to make the visit;
but at last he got away, and hurried to the prison.
The joy with which Arthur greeted him made it
all the more difficult for the Earl to prepare him
for the approaching separation. When the Duke
learned the King&rsquo;s intention, he lost his self-control
and entreated Salisbury not to leave him. Vainly
the Earl assured him that John had bound himself
by a sacred promise that he would do nothing to
harm his nephew. He clung to his only friend as
he sought to tear himself away, crying out in utter
despair, &ldquo;My last hope departs with you, noble
Salisbury.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>In great agitation Salisbury left the unfortunate
youth, and the next day marched out of Mirabeau,
filled with gloomy apprehensions and wishing that
he had never entered it and taken Arthur prisoner.</p>
<p>In a few weeks the relations of those who had
met in Mirabeau were radically changed. Queen
Eleanor had to remain there alone, though very reluctantly,
as she was detained by a severe illness.
It seemed as if the sight of Arthur&rsquo;s face had aroused
the torments of conscience, for, from the day when
she was forced to deliver him into John&rsquo;s power she
had grown weak and ill, both in body and mind.
As soon as he could make the arrangements John
left Mirabeau, taking his nephew with him. Though
closely guarded, Arthur enjoyed considerable freedom
on the road, and followed the army on horseback.
But before they were out of Normandy the
prisoner&rsquo;s guards suddenly took him away in another
direction from that of the army, and landed him in
the castle of Falaise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>In that gloomy castle Arthur experienced all the
hardships of imprisonment and passed his days in
hopeless solitude. At the beginning of winter he
was taken to Rouen and confined in a strong tower
on the bank of the Seine. Though joyous and
cheerful by nature, he lost all courage and hope, and
fell into utter despair. His young days seemed like
a dream, and as he recalled them he asked himself
over and over again, &ldquo;What has become of Alan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time which seemed so long to Arthur was
passed by Alan in almost constant toil and hardship.
How many dangers, plots, and delays he had to
overcome before he finally reached Paris! He
entered upon his mission for Arthur at once, but it
was soon apparent that the task was hopeless.
Where could he look for advice and assistance?
King Philip being far away with his army, Alan was
powerless to carry out Arthur&rsquo;s wishes, and yet the
Princesses were expecting aid from him. He visited
Abraham, who remained steadfast to the Duke; yet
the Jew required time to raise the money and make
inquiries just when Alan had to face new dangers at
every turn. When Abraham learned from his relatives
that Arthur had left Rouen, his alarm increased,
for he feared the worst if he met John. The utmost
despatch was now necessary, and Abraham
showed his willingness to help Alan in his plans for
the Duke&rsquo;s rescue. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said the Jew, &ldquo;he has
done me a great favor and has made an asylum for
my people. But, alas, King John persecutes the
children of Israel, and has sworn to extirpate our
race.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Alan advised with Abraham about every move he
made, and finally decided to repair at once to the
neighborhood of the Duke; then he arranged to
meet Abraham in Rouen and decide what further
steps were necessary in Arthur&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Tower of Rouen</span></h2>
<p>The Duke&rsquo;s only recreation was an occasional
visit to the tower balcony, where&mdash;under
the eye of his guard&mdash;he enjoyed
walking, as well as the bracing winter air.
A high parapet prevented him from looking down
where the Seine flowed by and vessels were passing
up and down the river, but he could hear the voices
and songs of the sailors as he paced backward and
forward. He endeavored to maintain a dignified
bearing when in the presence of the witnesses of
his misfortune, but his pale cheeks showed traces
of the bitter tears he had shed in his solitude.</p>
<p>One morning he went to the balcony as usual with
Hubert de Burgh, captain of the guard. The wind
blew violently about the old tower, and as Arthur
went out on the balcony to listen to the stir of the
world below, Hubert, who was in a surly mood,
sheltered himself near the entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>As Arthur listened to the songs of the sailors on
the river below, why was it that his face suddenly
lit up with joy and that his eyes flashed with delight?
Fortunately Hubert could not see his face, as Arthur
was standing with his back to him.</p>
<p>What was the melody to which he listened so
eagerly? Surely it was Blondel&rsquo;s song,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> which the
faithful minstrel once sung under the walls of the
prison where Richard the Lion-hearted was confined,
and which Arthur had often sung with Alan, little
dreaming that he too would be a prisoner one day.
If his ear did not deceive him it was Alan&rsquo;s voice,
only it was weaker and more tremulous than usual.
And yet no other could sing the song like that. He
longed to sing it in reply, but his guard, wondering
why he stopped his walk so long, approached. The
singer ceased as Arthur wiped his heated brow.
Suddenly his handkerchief flew into the air. Arthur
pretended to be catching it, but it fluttered high above
the balcony and then sank downwards like a white
dove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have lost your handkerchief,&rdquo; said the
guard, &ldquo;for it will either fall into the water or catch
upon the walls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was very precious to me,&rdquo; replied Arthur;
&ldquo;my mother embroidered it.&rdquo; Thereupon he left
the balcony. The handkerchief fell into the water
and was picked up by a young sailor boy, who came
there on a stone vessel the day before. It was this
boy who had sung Blondel&rsquo;s song. He took the
wet handkerchief and looked at it with beaming
eyes. Then he uttered a cry, not like that of a
sailor, but like that with which the hunter calls his
falcon.</p>
<p>On the following morning two weary female pilgrims
arrived at the eastern gate of Rouen. When
questioned by the guard, they showed letters to the
Abbess of the Marien Convent, and were directed
to the place. After kneeling in prayer for some
time at the altar of the cathedral near by, they arose
and went to the convent. As the elder pilgrim
desired to present the letters in person, they were
shown into the reception-room, where the Abbess
awaited them behind a latticed door. Approaching
it the pilgrim said, &ldquo;Admit us, reverend mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know that only the King and the
Princesses have that privilege?&rdquo; replied the Abbess.
Thereupon the two unveiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Constance of Brittany,&rdquo; said the elder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Marie of France,&rdquo; added the other
in a low voice.</p>
<p>The Abbess bowed in great surprise and admitted
the pair. &ldquo;What seek you, gracious Princesses?&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have vowed to tarry here in prayer until
the Holy Mother of God answers our petition,&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And supposing the Holy One refuses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall pray for a poor soul until our
latest breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your right to command,&rdquo; said the Abbess,
conducting them to the interior of the cloister.</p>
<p>In that very hour an aged Jew came to the south
gate of the city with a ragbag on his shoulder and
a staff in his hand. He exhibited his passports
to the gate-keepers, and although they gave him
permission to leave Paris and go to Rouen on business,
he was stopped and insulted upon every sort
of pretext. He bore the raillery of the rough soldiers
patiently and mutely, only protesting now and
then, &ldquo;My papers permit me to enter the city and
seek lodgings with my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you in such a hurry, Jew?&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;Perhaps you have business
with the King of England, who is coming to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jew shot a swift glance at the speaker and
meekly replied, &ldquo;A poor craftsman can have nothing
to do with so fine a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo; provokingly answered the captain.
&ldquo;When princes are preparing to cross the
seas there are fine bargains to be made with their
followers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me enter and find out if I can make
any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jew snaps at such a chance like a fish at
the bait,&rdquo; said the captain with a sneer. &ldquo;Now
hurry, son of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jew promptly availed himself of the opportunity,
folded his papers, and passed through the
partly open gate. A soldier of the watch hurried
him on his way with a thrust of his lance shaft,
and the spare figure soon disappeared among the
crooked old streets. The Jew, who was Abraham,
had at last accomplished his purpose. In the secret
hiding-place of one of his own faith he could have
interviews with all kinds of people, who passed
in and out all day. Samples of wares were strewn
about the tables; but these people, who were
mostly knights or seamen, did not come to purchase.
Among them was Alan, who late one evening
found himself alone with Abraham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know all now. I may not be able to help
you further,&rdquo; said Abraham. &ldquo;But this is my plan:
When King John comes into port, bringing the Duke
with him, a second boat will follow, carrying the
servants and baggage. The captain and crew have
been won over. God knows at what price,&rdquo; he
added with a groan. &ldquo;They will keep you until
the harbor is reached. Then the King and his
retinue, including Duke Arthur, will embark upon
a large sea vessel, for the King will not allow him
to be out of his sight until he safely lands him
in England. The confusion of the night embarkation
will allow you to approach unobserved, and
you must improve the opportunity to separate the
Duke from the others and get him to your boat.
Have him concealed there, and leave as quickly as
possible. It is the last faint possibility of escape,
for no power can save him or get him out of the
tower, now that John has control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where will the sailors in the little boat take
us?&rdquo; said Alan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;They know all the coves and inlets of the coast&mdash;they
often conceal themselves in them from the
pirates,&rdquo; said Abraham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that we succeed! Arthur knows that
I am near, and he will be in readiness for instant
flight. This is the surety of it,&rdquo; said Alan, pressing
Arthur&rsquo;s handkerchief to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, brave youth,&rdquo; said Abraham. &ldquo;Do
what your heart prompts. A truer one never beat
under the sun. I shall leave Rouen early to-morrow
morning and return to Paris that suspicion
may not fall upon me and my people should your
undertaking be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted, and Alan returned to the vessel.
His route led him past the ancient tower, which
was not so quiet and dark as usual. Torches
illuminated the gate and battlements, and lights
shone in the windows; for King John had arrived,
and the din of his soldiery could be heard even
through the thick walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">On the Seine</span></h2>
<p>The report of the King&rsquo;s approaching
departure had attracted a great throng
of spectators to the bank of the Seine,
opposite the tower. They were curious
to see the King, but more eager to see the Duke
of Brittany, whose name was heard on every side.
Vessels of moderate size could come close up to
the gates on the water side, which closed the entrance
to the tower. Two boats were in waiting
some distance off. The smaller was fully manned,
and loaded with chests and bales, ready for departure.
The deck of the larger, which floated the
royal ensign, was empty, the crew being below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>It was late when the signal for leaving was given.
The gates were opened, torch-bearers advanced and
lighted the stairs, which were flanked by two rows
of halberdiers. Between them, knights, soldiers,
and nobles, with the Duke in their midst, descended.
Arthur stopped upon the stair an instant,
looking about as if in search of some one, but he
was quickly forced along to the gangway leading
from the stairs to the boat. He and his guards
had hardly stepped aboard when the King&rsquo;s approach
was announced. John immediately appeared,
mounted the deck, and disappeared below. The
rowers struck out, the sails filled, and the vessel
moved to the middle of the stream. The boat
with the baggage followed a little distance away
from it. A dark figure rose from time to time in
the bows, eagerly scrutinizing the King&rsquo;s vessel.
It was Alan in sailor&rsquo;s dress, on the lookout for
Arthur. The deck of the other vessel, however,
remained empty for some time. It gleamed white
in the light of the rising moon; its masts and sails
were sharply outlined against the clear night sky,
and only the monotonous plash of oars broke the
stillness.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i><span class="sc">The</span> assassination of Arthur</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>But when the city was left behind and
the vessel was gliding along between the deserted
banks of the rushing river, two figures appeared on
deck and gradually proceeded to the stern, which
was clearly visible to Alan. He could see it was
the King and Arthur engaged in conversation, and
could even distinctly hear some of their words.
Arthur was in modest attire, and his short mantle
was carelessly worn. King John was dressed in
a broad dark cloak which left one arm free, and
wore a fur-trimmed cap. The speakers stood some
distance apart, but as the conversation continually
grew louder, it was perfectly audible to Alan. The
familiar sound of Arthur&rsquo;s voice deeply touched
his heart, and he eagerly listened to its tones.
Suddenly he heard the King&rsquo;s questioning voice
full of sullen rage, and Arthur&rsquo;s loud, firm reply
to him, &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; At the same time he
saw the Duke with upturned face raise his hands
to heaven in a supplicating manner. As Arthur
stood thus, facing the King with unprotected breast,
the latter sprang at him. A dagger gleamed in his
hand, and like a flash he drove the blade into the
Duke&rsquo;s heart. A dreadful cry followed, and was
repeated by the echo of another voice. The King
lifted the weapon and pierced his victim a second
time. The dying youth staggered to the edge of
the vessel and fell into the river. The King looked
searchingly over the side and then flung the dagger
into the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Forgetting all caution, Alan leaned over in his
boat, watching with horror-stricken eyes the crimsoned
water in the wake of the King&rsquo;s vessel. A
golden ringlet rose and glistened in the moonlight
for an instant; then the waves closed over it, and
it disappeared.</p>
<p>Proudly sailed the vessel bearing the King to its
haven. Sunk and forever lost in the waters of the
Seine was the Duke of Brittany.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Accusation</span></h2>
<p>King John murdered his nephew at
night, unseen, as he supposed, by any
human eye, and yet he was at once harassed
by constant fear. He did not draw an easy
breath until he landed upon the English coast and
stood upon soil which had not been stained by his
bloody deed. Almost as soon as the King&rsquo;s vessel
arrived, rumor was busy, however, and hinted of
the crime John had committed. Although the
people submissively obeyed him, they looked upon
him with suspicion, and at last accusations were
made openly.</p>
<p>When John assembled the lords and peers for
the first time, the venerable Pembroke, their mouth-piece,
asked the King this question: &ldquo;Where is
Arthur, son of Geoffrey, the noble scion of the
Plantagenets?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The cowardly and conscience-stricken King sought
to evade a reply, but he was besieged with a storm
of demands and accusations, and Pembroke reproached
both himself and his friends because they
had left Arthur in the cruel hands of his uncle.</p>
<p>The King at last answered in a rage: &ldquo;The peers
must first prove the act before they condemn me.&rdquo;
An instant&rsquo;s silence ensued, for they could not provide
the proofs; and John looked with insolent
scorn at the embarrassed nobles. But before the
King could follow up his opportunity, a herald entered
the hall, announcing that an unknown knight,
attended by squires and heralds, had brought a message
for the King from Philip Augustus of France.
It was an unfortunate time to receive the commission,
but he did not dare to refuse audience to
Philip&rsquo;s ambassador.</p>
<p>Preceded by a herald carrying a roll of parchment
in his hand, with the royal seal appended, a knight
in full black armor entered the hall. John was
greatly agitated as he saw him approaching, and
was still more alarmed when the knight raised his
visor and displayed the stern features of a youthful
face. It seemed to him for an instant that Arthur
stood there to accuse him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The stranger bowed haughtily to the King, and
with exceeding courtesy to the nobles, and then
spoke: &ldquo;In the name and by the authority of King
Philip of France I summon you, John Plantagenet
of Anjou, before the tribunal of your sovereign lord
at Paris, to answer for the murder of your nephew,
Duke Arthur of Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John stamped his foot with rage. &ldquo;This is most
presumptuous,&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;It will be time for
Philip to sit in judgment on me when he has found
some one to accuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I stand, Knight Alan of Mordant, from
Brittany, as your accuser,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;I saw you
commit the murder, and am ready to prove all the
circumstances. Do you doubt my testimony?&rdquo; he
asked, as he saw John make a gesture of contempt.
&ldquo;Well then, behold this dagger.&rdquo; Alan drew the
weapon from his cloak and held it toward the King.
&ldquo;Do you recognize your name and arms on the
blade? It may well be rusty, for it has not only
lain in the waters of the Seine three days, but also
has been bathed in Arthur&rsquo;s blood. Do you deny
it, King John? Do you shake your fist at me? If
so, I will maintain the truth of my accusation by my
knightly honor, and here I cast my glove into the
circle of these noble knights. I summon him to
mortal combat who will deny my accusation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Alan threw down his glove and replaced the
dagger in his cloak. The King looked around the
circle of his gallant knights almost supplicatingly,
but he saw only gloomy and lowering faces, and no
one moved to take the glove from the floor. There
was universal silence until the King summoned the
herald, who took the glove into his keeping.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his discomfiture, John craftily
made a bold move to stem the tide of his fast
failing cause. Turning to Alan, he said, &ldquo;If we,
as is likely, shall refuse to recognize the summons
of Philip of France, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Alan, &ldquo;King Philip will
declare you, John of England, dispossessed of all
your property and fiefs on French soil, and will
immediately appropriate them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let him attempt it!&rdquo; shouted John in thundering
tones. &ldquo;Hear you, my lords and knights!
Philip may execute this summons, but he will not
strike me. He will strike at England and England&rsquo;s
greatness. It is Philip&rsquo;s purpose to wrest
from us the country which is the birthplace of our
ancestors, the land whence sprang our knighthood,
majestic Normandy, beautiful Anjou and Maine.
That is the explanation of all his virtuous anger
over the death of the boy Arthur. What is that
boy&rsquo;s life, what is my own life, provided England&rsquo;s
greatness remain unimpaired? Which one of you,
my knights, will hesitate when he is called upon to
fight for English honor and English possessions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John looked around the assembly confident of
victory, took the summons, tore it in two, and threw
the pieces on the floor. &ldquo;There is the answer you
shall take to Philip of France, Knight Mordant,
and you may leave England in three days. For
that length of time you have the privileges of an
ambassador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a firm step John left the hall, and the
nobles followed him with unsettled convictions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The End</span></h2>
<p>The English army invaded France again,
only to meet with defeat. England lost
both fame and possessions: Philip wrested
the latter from her. The entire population
of Brittany rushed to arms after Arthur&rsquo;s
murder, and drove the enemy out of their country.
Alan, their leader, continually roused them to resistance
and incited them to avenge their murdered
Duke. He would not tolerate any foreign ruler,
and encouraged all classes to maintain their independence
both against England and France. He
demonstrated his patriotism and achieved victory, but
at the cost of his life in defence of his fatherland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Arthur was avenged. The contempt of all England,
worse even than death to bear, was visited upon
John when he returned from France. Detested by
his subjects, mistrusted by the nobles, shamefully
begging help from the Pope to keep his throne, his
life came to an end in an era of turbulence. His
lords, joining hands with the commons, extorted
from him that important concession of rights, Magna
Charta,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> and compelled this execrable despot to lay
the foundations of the greatness of the English
people. Old and worn out with sickness, believing
himself poisoned, racked with remorse, harassed by
rebellious leaders, John died in the midst of an
insurrection.</p>
<p>The derisive epithet, &ldquo;John Lackland,&rdquo; has
branded him in history as a spurious and cruel
sovereign. The figure of Arthur of Brittany, glorified
in poetry, beautified with the immortal lustre
of youth, stands out brightly against the dark
background of those bloody days.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>Geoffrey was born September 23, 1158, and died August 19, 1186. He
married Constance of Brittany.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>Henry II was the first king of England of the house of Plantagenet. Outside
of England he possessed Normandy and the suzerainty of Brittany, which he
inherited from the Norman kings; Anjou and Maine from his father, and by
marriage with Eleanor, Poitou, Guienne, and Gascony.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>This is one version of the manner in which Geoffrey came to his death. The
generally accepted historical version is that he was killed at a tournament in Paris.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>Duke Arthur of Brittany was born at Nantes, France, March 29, 1187, and
was killed at Rouen, April 3, 1203. According to the author of this story, he
was murdered on shipboard by King John, his uncle, because he refused to waive
his lawful claim to the throne of England. History fails to make an authoritative
statement of the manner of the young hero&rsquo;s death, but it is unanimously conceded
that John procured his assassination, if he did not commit the deed himself.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>Rennes, capital of Ille-et-Vilaine, France, was the capital of ancient Brittany.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a>Philip Augustus, King of France, was born in 1165, and died in 1223. He
was the son of Louis VII, and was noted for his banishment of the Jews, his
participation in the Third Crusade with Richard the Lion-hearted, and the crusade
against the Albigenses.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>&ldquo;The King left only two legitimate sons,&mdash;Richard, who succeeded him, and
John, who inherited no territory, though his father had often intended to leave
him a part of his extensive dominion. He was thence commonly denominated
&lsquo;Lackland.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Hume.</span>
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>Henry the Second, King of England, died July 6, 1189. In the last year of
his reign he was confronted with the rebellion of his sons Richard and John, in
which they were assisted by Philip Augustus of France.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>Geoffrey, the father of Arthur, had been concerned in a previous rebellion
against his father, instigated, like that of Richard and John, by Queen Eleanor.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>This was the Third Crusade (1189-92), which was led by Frederick Barbarossa
of Germany (see the volume &ldquo;Barbarossa&rdquo; in this series), Richard the Lion-hearted
of England, and Philip Augustus of France. They failed to recover
Jerusalem, which had been recaptured by the Mussulmans in 1187.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>Richard the First, surnamed the Lion-hearted, was born September 8, 1157,
and was the third son of Henry the Second. He was killed in a war with Philip
Augustus of France, John&rsquo;s ally.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>The author&rsquo;s chronology is at fault in this connection. Godfrey of Bouillon
was a leader in the First Crusade, and died at Jerusalem in 1100, before the period
of this story.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Acre, in Palestine, was captured by the Crusaders in 1191, and Ascalon in
1153. The latter city was the birthplace of Herod the First.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>Henry the Sixth, born in 1165, was the son of Barbarossa, whom he
succeeded as King of Germany in 1190.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>Trifels was an imperial fortress in the Rhine Palatinate, near Annweiler,
which was the resort of medi&aelig;val emperors. Only its ruins remain.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>The Louvre, now one of the world&rsquo;s famous art museums, was a castle of the
kings of France from the thirteenth century, and the chief royal palace until Versailles
was built by Louis the Fourteenth. Most of the interior has been occupied
as a museum since 1793.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>Marie of France was the daughter of Philip Augustus.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>Montjoie is the name of a hill near Paris where Saint Denis was murdered.
In tournaments &ldquo;Montjoie&rdquo; was the cry of the French heralds; and &ldquo;Montjoie
St. Denis&rdquo; was the French battle-cry.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>Compi&egrave;gne is a town in the Department of Oise, France, and is famous for
the royal palace rebuilt by Louis the Fifteenth. Napoleon the First greatly enriched
its interior.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>Blondel was a <i>trouv&egrave;re</i>, or minstrel, who accompanied Richard the Lion-hearted,
and is said to have discovered him when he was imprisoned by singing a
song under the King&rsquo;s tower, to which Richard responded.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a>Hume accepts the following account of the murder as the most reliable:
&ldquo;John first removed him to the castle of Rouen; and coming in a boat, during
the night time, to that place, commanded Arthur to be brought forth to him.
The young prince, aware of his danger, and now more subdued by the continuance
of his misfortunes and by the approach of death, threw himself on his knees
before his uncle and begged for mercy; but the barbarous tyrant, making no reply,
stabbed him with his own hands, and, fastening a stone to the dead body, threw
it into the Seine.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a>Magna Charta, the charter of English liberties, signed by John and his barons
at Runnymede, June 15, 1215.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a>Hume says of John: &ldquo;Cowardice, inactivity, folly, levity, licentiousness,
ingratitude, treachery, tyranny, and cruelty,&mdash;all these qualities appear too evidently
in the several incidents of his life to give us room to suspect that the
disagreeable picture has been anywise overcharged by the prejudices of the ancient
historians.&rdquo;
